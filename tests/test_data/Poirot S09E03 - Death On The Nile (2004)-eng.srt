00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:21,778
<i><b>Based on Agatha Christie's novel
DEATH ON THE NILE </b></i>

2
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,508
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright, my darling.

3
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:30,865
I just can't believe
that they'd do this.

4
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:32,861
I know, I know...

5
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,819
- Everything I touch...
- You mustn't think like that.

6
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:40,188
We have each other,
and our whole lives to look forward to.

7
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:44,146
I'm broke, Jackie.
What sort of a future is that?

8
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:48,022
Well, I have some put aside.
That'll save us for a little while.

9
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:52,097
I'll think of something,
I promise.

10
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:54,187
I promise you, my darling.

11
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,949
We love each other and
that's all that matters, yes?

12
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:18,127
She's had the most terrible luck.

13
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:19,628
When we were students together,
in Paris,

14
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:21,534
her father ran off with some woman

15
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:24,649
and her mother lost all her money
in the stock market crash.

16
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,290
And Jackie was left absolute penniless.

17
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:28,891
I don't know how she's managed
these past few years.

18
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:32,532
- Oh, she wants something, I bet.
- I've offered to help, but she won't hear of it.

19
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:35,370
Isn't it awful when one's friends
fall on hard times?

20
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:37,169
One's simply got to drop them.

21
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:38,650
She sounded very excited,

22
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:41,416
but then she always does.
It's the Latine in her.

23
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:44,496
The boys' are back from their ramble.
England's manhood...!

24
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:48,610
You and Tim seem awfully close.
Is there something I don't know about?

25
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:52,696
Heavens, no! The only woman
in Tim Allerton's life is his mummy.

26
00:02:52,977 --> 00:02:55,491
It's all far too "Sophoclean"
for my taste.

27
00:02:56,617 --> 00:03:00,405
And what about the good Lord?
Still panting for you, is he?

28
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:02,209
He's not the panting type.

29
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:05,056
According to the gossip columnists,
you're halfway up the aisle.

30
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:08,374
No! Not yet! Not ever.
Not with him, anyway.

31
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:11,256
But, darling, he's absolutely rolling.

32
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,016
So am I.

33
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:18,574
Ah, so divine! I bet these cost
more than the house.

34
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:23,095
Looks and money.
I can't believe I like you.

35
00:03:23,257 --> 00:03:26,249
- Joanna, darling, you don't like anyone.
- Don't I? Oh, well...

36
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,606
Yes?

37
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:34,172
Mademoiselle de Bellefort
will be here for supper.

38
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,616
Thank you, Louise.

39
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:41,294
What on earth's wrong with her?

40
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:44,451
Look, that ghastly boyfriend
is in trouble with the law

41
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:47,933
and can you believe she's asked me
to send bail for him? I said, ''On no account

42
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:55,376
Allow me.

43
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:59,335
God, I wonder what Jackie wants?

44
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:05,688
The fact is, darling, I'm engaged...

45
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:07,609
So, that's it! Who is he?

46
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:12,055
His name's Simon Doyle. And he's big,
and boyish and deliciously uncomplicated.

47
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:13,936
He worked in the City,

48
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:17,607
but they, well, are cutting down,
and he's out of his job.

49
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:20,735
Linnet, I'll die, if I can't marry him,
I shall simply die!

50
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:23,809
- Dear, you've got it bad!
- When I heard you had bought this place

51
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:26,656
I realized you'd be needing a land agent,
and then I thought ''Simon!''

52
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:28,196
Oh, darling, he'd be just perfect.

53
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:30,577
He loves the country
and knows all about estates

54
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:34,128
and if he doesn't do it right,
well, you can always sack him.

55
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:36,608
Say <i>oui,</i> Linnet! Please!

56
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:39,128
Oh, I knew you wouldn't let me down!

57
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:42,183
We want to go to Egypt for
our honeymoon. Can you imagine?

58
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,972
Walking down an avenue of Sphynxes
with the man you love?

59
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:46,775
Could anything be more romantic?

60
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:48,888
Bring him along
and I'll take a look.

61
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,725
- Well, actually he's here.
- What?

62
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:55,050
Just in case you said yes.
You'll adore him.

63
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:01,730
Simon!

64
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:08,368
This is Simon Doyle.
Simon, this is Linnet Ridgeway,

65
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:11,247
the most wonderful friend
a girl can have.

66
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:21,372
Well, now,
isn't this simply lovely.

67
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:51,694
Isn't that Hercule Poirot?

68
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:57,207
Do you mean that dwarfish looking creature
mincing down the stairs?

69
00:05:57,377 --> 00:05:59,174
That's not very nice of you.

70
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:02,976
What on earth is he doing here?

71
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:10,173
I'd love someone would dance
with me.

72
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:13,135
But who on this planet would dance
with you?

73
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:16,775
- Perhaps someone would want me, if...
- And pigs might fly.

74
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:19,810
Remember, my dear,
why you're here...

75
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:22,647
- To be handy, cousin Marie.
- Precisely.

76
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:26,213
After you prepared my "coucher",
you may attend to my eggnog.

77
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:31,053
You're not getting grumpy,
are you, my darling?

78
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:34,135
- If there were more young people around...
- Whatever for?

79
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:38,373
- You'd like it if Joanna were here.
- No, no I wouldn't.

80
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:42,736
In fact, I wouldn't care
if I wouldn't see Joanna ever again.

81
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:45,936
I don't need Joanna
when I have you...

82
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:49,295
Oh! Darling...

83
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:58,695
- My God, did you see that?
- Keep your voice down.

84
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:01,929
- She could be his mother.
- She is his mother.

85
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:05,576
I need some air.

86
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:10,976
<i>Merci.</i>

87
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,696
<i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>

88
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,453
<i>- Madame.</i>
- Salome Otterbourne.

89
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:22,932
<i>- Enchanté.</i>
- That French charme.

90
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:25,691
- You French are all the same.
- I am Belgian, Madame.

91
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:30,092
I was thinking if you'd care
to take the magic trip avec <i>moi?</i>

92
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:32,573
- Trip?
- I know this is the wrong way round,

93
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:35,490
but, after all, we are...
liberated now.

94
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:45,055
I was a great supporter
of the "Suffragettes", you know...

95
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:50,090
So, are you here on business, Monsieur?
Are there great affairs to be dealt with?

96
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,572
You know, Madame,
I am simply the man of leisure.

97
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:56,608
Essential, <i>n'est-ce pas,</i>
to be out of London in January?

98
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,208
Poor man.
She's got her claws into him already.

99
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:03,210
I'm here for the local colour.
My new book,

100
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:06,535
''Snow on the Desert's Face'',
is set on these parts.

101
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:09,792
No doubt, of course,
it'll cause another furor,

102
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:11,893
but, no matter, I speak the truth.

103
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,891
Why is everyone so affraid
of sex?

104
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:20,409
The stars of the show.

105
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:23,455
You'd think she'd have
some sense of shame.

106
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:25,050
Don't be so old-fashioned.

107
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:27,009
She's rather lovely,
I must admit.

108
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:30,493
Linnet Doyle is the only heiress
in England who doesn't look like an horse.

109
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:33,245
Hello, Andrew.

110
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:34,731
Spectacular!

111
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:36,165
Right over here.

112
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:42,573
It seems that everybody who is anybody
is in Egypt, <i>ce soir.</i>

113
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:45,852
The lure of the fresh spot,
no doubt.

114
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:47,615
- Remember Simon?
- Yes.

115
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:49,536
Incredible, isn't it?

116
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,409
Millions unemployed,

117
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:57,570
a lunatic about to take the power
in Germany and all we read about is

118
00:08:57,697 --> 00:09:01,326
some spoiled brat ditched a Lord
for her best friend's fiancé.

119
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,208
Some people have everything.

120
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:08,171
Depends on
what you think's worth having.

121
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,647
- Hello, Simon.
- Hi, how are you?

122
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:16,296
Hello, Tim.

123
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:17,691
Linnet, you're divine.

124
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,486
This Andrew Pennington, my american trustee.
We just bumped in him in Cairo.

125
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:23,568
Oh, yes, quite a coincidence...

126
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,853
Mother, I'm sure Monsieur Poirot
would like to rest.

127
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:28,252
<i>Non, non, non...</i>
I think that is a great idea.

128
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:32,695
<i>Non, non,</i> because my dinner seems
a little reluctant to settle.

129
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:34,490
If you'll excuse me...

130
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:37,809
Of course, <i>Monsieur.</i>
We shall resume <i>très bientôt.</i>

131
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:40,332
<i>Au revoir.</i>

132
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,131
Linnet!

133
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,533
What a simply divine surprise!

134
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:02,814
We just can't stop bumping
into each other, can we?

135
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,416
Hello, Simon.

136
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:09,088
You look a little tired, darling.
Wearing you out, is she?

137
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:14,647
I'd hang on tight, ducky (dear).
He's a slippery fish.

138
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:18,610
I'll be seeing you.

139
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:24,495
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

140
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:31,046
- <i>Mademoiselle.</i>
- I hope my mother

141
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:32,935
hasn't exhausted you.

142
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:35,412
- Not at all.
- I know how exhausting she can be.

143
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:38,931
- Linnet Doyle's very beautiful, isn't she?
-<i> Oui, Mademoiselle.</i>

144
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,689
And very rich too.

145
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:43,576
I read about her in the papers, of couse,
seen her photograph everywhere,

146
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:46,450
but nothing can quite prepare you
for how lovely she's in the flesh.

147
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:49,655
I don't think I've ever
hated anyone so much on first sight.

148
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,336
But not all that glitters...

149
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:56,129
Not in her case.
Life is not fair, <i>Monsieur Poirot.

150
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:59,007
Has life been unfair to you,
<i>Mademoiselle?

151
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:00,816
You've met my mother.

152
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:10,256
<i>Monsieur Poirot.

153
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,568
- I didn't mean to startle you...
- <i>Non, non, non...</i>

154
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:14,733
... but I am very anxious
to speak to you.

155
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,250
At your service, <i>Madame.

156
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,932
- You know who I am, perhaps?...
- Yes, I know exactly who you are.

157
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:20,893
I'll go straight to the point:

158
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:23,490
I'm a victim
of an intolerable persecution.

159
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,770
Persecution?

160
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,688
Perhaps if you could explain
a little further...?

161
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:31,496
It's really very simple.
Before I met my husband,

162
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:34,495
he was engaged to a friend of mine,
Jacqueline de Bellefort.

163
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:37,256
Now, they weren't remotely suited
and he broke it off.

164
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:40,011
She, I'm sorry to say,
has taken it rather badly,

165
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:43,772
and, out of pure spite, has chosen
to hound us wherever we go.

166
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,128
And you are here, I understand,
on your honeymoon...

167
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:48,817
That's right. Now, she first appeared
in Venice,

168
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:51,690
and then in Brindisi, then in Cairo,
and now here.

169
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:54,291
She simply cannot be allowed
to carry on like this.

170
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:57,366
But she's perfectly within
her rights.

171
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:00,045
I'm sorry, did you not see
the way she behaved just now?

172
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,512
<i>Oui,</i> but she did not
actually threaten you,

173
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:04,511
or cause you any bodily harm.

174
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:07,256
<i>Non,</i> evidently she is very much
aggrieved, <i>Madame.</i>

175
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:09,935
If you're implying that I stole
my friend's fiancé,

176
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:11,935
then I assure you're wrong.

177
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:13,854
She loved him, yes,

178
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:16,053
but her feelings
were not reciprocated.

179
00:12:16,177 --> 00:12:18,486
Even before he met me,
he knew he'd make a mistake.

180
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:22,206
But wasn't there a moment
when you realized that you had a choice?

181
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:24,876
You have everything,
but your friend,

182
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:28,014
from what I understand,
had him only.

183
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:31,765
<i>Non.</i> Pardon my impertinence,
<i>Madame,</i> but

184
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:34,566
I suspect you're feeling
a little guilty.

185
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:38,053
Couldn't you, at least,
try to reason with her?

186
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:39,849
<i>Madame,</i> I am on holiday.

187
00:12:40,017 --> 00:12:42,372
I'm sure we could come
to some kind of arrangement.

188
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:45,135
<i>Non, Madame,</i>

189
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:47,934
I am sure we could not.

190
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:51,170
Excuse me.

191
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,568
She did threaten to kill us,
you know.

192
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:00,577
But then, she does have a tendency
to be a little dramatic.

193
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:27,768
I suppose you saw
our little floor show...

194
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:29,171
<i>Oui, Mademoiselle.</i>

195
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,248
I'm affraid I rather lost my head.

196
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:34,930
They serve us
the most lethal Martinis in this place.

197
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,133
Bury your dead, <i>Mademoiselle.

198
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:41,176
Mrs. Doyle sent you?
Got you on her payroll already, has she?

199
00:13:41,297 --> 00:13:43,731
She has approached me,
that is true, but I declined.

200
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:47,135
You must look to the future.

201
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:50,451
- Oh, she'd love that!
- I'm thinking of you.

202
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:55,570
- You have before you your whole life.
- Simon is my life.

203
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:57,893
I can see that you loved him...

204
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:03,491
We loved each other, <i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>
And Linnet was my best friend.

205
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,366
- How could she...?
- It takes two.

206
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:11,367
She knew exactly what she was doing
and he fell for it.

207
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:14,776
One of the richest women
in England,

208
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:17,286
no wonder it went to his head.

209
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:21,486
You know, we had even planned
to come here for our honeymoon?

210
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:25,134
- He loves me, <i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>
- Even now?

211
00:14:27,497 --> 00:14:29,852
No, not now.

212
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:33,566
Now I think he hates me.

213
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:41,770
Pretty, isn't it?

214
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:47,851
I've quite a good shot, actually.
My father taught me.

215
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:52,335
I have to admit it crossed
my mind to use it,

216
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,485
but then I thought... no.

217
00:14:57,377 --> 00:15:00,892
Wouldn't it be much more fun
to just follow wherever they went

218
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:05,449
and just when they thought
it was safe to relax,

219
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:07,975
there I'd be,

220
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:10,655
the ghost of the banquet.

221
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:13,934
- You must stop this now.
- And let them get away with it?

222
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:16,976
Do not open your heart to evil,
<i>Mademoiselle.

223
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:20,527
If you do, there'll be no turning back.

224
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:25,489
She has taken everything from me,
Monsieur Poirot.

225
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,327
And I want to hurt her,

226
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:33,569
to put my gun against her head

227
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:37,528
and, gently, pull the trigger...

228
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:41,169
Oh God, I'm so affraid.

229
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:47,131
What is it?

230
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:49,606
Over there...
someone was listening...

231
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:53,932
- I cannot see.
- I think they're gone.

232
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,651
I can not do what you ask,
<i>Monsieur Poirot.

233
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:26,165
Good morning.

234
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:28,335
<i>Bonjour, Monsieur Doyle.</i>

235
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:30,966
- And how is <i>Madame?
- Absolutely pooked (tired),

236
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:33,093
said she needed
a little more shutter.

237
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:37,208
God, I'm  ravenous! Isn't it marvellous
they're doing English breakfast here?

238
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:39,845
I cannot stand those little brioche...
Do you?

239
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:43,451
Did you--
Have you managed to speak to Jacqueline...

240
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:46,093
<i>- Miss de Bellefort?
- Oui.</i>

241
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:50,046
- Did you get her to see sense, or...?
- Non, I'm affraid not.

242
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:53,171
But decent girls just
don't do that sort of thing!

243
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:56,846
She's making a complete ass of herself
and playing merry hell with Linnet's nerves!

244
00:16:57,537 --> 00:17:00,927
- And yours, <i>Monsieur</i>?
- Oh, I'd like to wring her neck!

245
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:05,057
Between ourselves, <i>Monsieur,</i>
I've hatched a plan.

246
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:07,254
I'm letting been known
that Linnet and I

247
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:09,094
are staying put
for the next couple of days,

248
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:12,488
but I've in fact booked us
on a Nile cruise leaving tomorrow morning,

249
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:15,006
under false names, of course.
- Of course.

250
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:17,013
Then we'll make it look like
we're going on an excursion,

251
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:18,613
the maid will take charge
of the luggage,

252
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,331
we'll hop aboard on the last minute,
and "Bob's yer uncle"!

253
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:25,729
By the time Jacqueline realizes
we won't be coming back, it'll be too late.

254
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:28,616
So, what do you think?
Good wits?

255
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:31,251
She has the brains, <i>Monsieur</i>.
We shall see.

256
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,567
- I myself will also be in the cruise.
- Really?

257
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:34,766
<i>Oui.</i>

258
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:36,853
Oh! Not on any way, I hope,
on our account...

259
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:39,810
<i>Non, non, non</i>. Not at all. I make
my plans well in advance.

260
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:42,497
That is the only way
to succeed in life, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

261
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,569
Yes, I suppose it is...

262
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:48,491
- Who is that gentleman?
- A chap called Pennington,

263
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:51,177
Linnet's trustee.
Bumped in him by chance in Cairo.

264
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:54,130
I must say he was not far from sick
to find out she was married.

265
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:55,975
- Care to join us?
- <i>Non, non, non.</i>

266
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:57,689
But thank you very much.

267
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:01,613
Jolly nice to talk to you, anyway.
To have old kidneys back there.

268
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:26,571
Isn't that our trunk?
You think it will be alright?

269
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:30,929
Welcome.
Welcome to the S.S. Karnak.

270
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:35,609
- I'm so sorry.
- Do you mind?

271
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:41,375
Off! Off! Don't let them touch
the luggage. They don't wash!

272
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:45,414
Heavens, a floating tomb!
Don't push me to the sea.

273
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:53,055
Oh! The black hole of Calcuta!

274
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:59,170
It's so beautiful!

275
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:02,409
- Where's my other luggage?
- I left it with the man.

276
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:05,331
<i>Merci.</i>

277
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:25,495
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

278
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:43,612
There's something about this place,
don't you think?

279
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:48,087
Something unsettling
one can't quite resist.

280
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,187
<i>Oui.</i>

281
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:52,494
I had no idea they were coming.

282
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,055
Oh, this is heaven, darling!

283
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:06,808
Darling, I thought
you were staying at the hotel!

284
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,728
What a hoot! I'm sure
we're having an absolute bore!

285
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:18,533
You refused to help, <i>Monsieur Poirot</i>,
look what happens.

286
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,045
But this is not my making, <i>Madame.

287
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,253
How could she have known
that we would be on the boat?

288
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,487
- If you are suggesting...
- I am suggesting nothing,

289
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,455
<i>Monsieur</i>, but I will tell you this,
everybody hates me, ok?

290
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:29,454
I'm surrounded by enemies.

291
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:56,169
The way some of them look...

292
00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:58,493
After all we've done for them...

293
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:03,253
<i>- Monsieur Poirot!
- Madame. Monsieur Allerton.</i>

294
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:09,456
Now, Mr. Poirot,

295
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:13,372
perhaps you could help put a face
on one or two of the passenger list.

296
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:18,455
- Dr. Bessner, for example.
- Over there, Madame.

297
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:21,333
Oh yes, the plump one,

298
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:24,534
with the shaved head
and the Bismarck moustache.

299
00:21:25,057 --> 00:21:27,491
- German, no doubt.
- No, Austrian, I believe.

300
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:29,010
A boche, whatever.

301
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:32,693
So, by a process of elimination,
the rather glum looking gentleman

302
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:35,936
must be Mr. Ferguson.
- <i>Oui</i>, a progressive thinker,

303
00:21:36,057 --> 00:21:38,366
so I understand.
- Bragging bolshy, more like.

304
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,817
Now, there's someone I'd throw
my cap into the arene for.

305
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:45,087
- Mother!
- That ruthless jaw.

306
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:48,648
And extremely rich.
As are most people here.

307
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:50,690
My, she's ugly!

308
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,606
Looks something unearthed
from a dig.

309
00:21:57,497 --> 00:21:58,976
Isn't she lovely?

310
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:01,651
<i>Madame.

311
00:22:01,897 --> 00:22:04,331
She really knows
how to make an entrance.

312
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:30,533
- Good night, <i>Mademoiselle</i>.
- Good night, <i>Monsieur Poirot</i>.

313
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:35,053
You were surprised
to find me here?

314
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:38,731
I am more sorry than surprised.

315
00:22:40,937 --> 00:22:43,770
You have chosen a path
that is most dangerous, <i>Mademoiselle.

316
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:46,770
I doubt that you would turn back now,
even if you could.

317
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:48,296
Ah, well...

318
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:51,772
One must follow one's star.

319
00:22:54,737 --> 00:22:56,648
Love is not everything.

320
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:01,735
But it is, it is.

321
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:05,768
You must know that, <i>Monsieur Poirot.

322
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:08,095
Surely you understand.

323
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:16,975
It is terrible, Mademoiselle,

324
00:23:19,257 --> 00:23:21,373
all that I have missed in life.

325
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:35,086
- Good night, <i>Monsieur Poirot</i>.
- Good night.

326
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:07,009
So, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Robson,
your companion, she does not come ashore?

327
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:10,294
Well, you see, cousin Marie has to be
very careful about her health,

328
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:13,335
but she was frightful kind and said
it would be alright for me to come.

329
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:16,096
- That is most gracious of her.
- Oh yes, she is.

330
00:24:16,297 --> 00:24:17,756
It's simply wonderful of her

331
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:20,257
to bring me on this trip.
I'm such a lucky girl!

332
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:26,135
I always dreamed of traveling. It's amazing,
have you ever in your life...?

333
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:35,776
Isn't it miraculous
what Man can create?

334
00:24:36,737 --> 00:24:38,932
People died building this,
you know?

335
00:24:39,097 --> 00:24:43,215
So you preferred it there were no sfynxes,
no beautiful tombs, no temples?

336
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:47,130
It's people that matter,
not stones.

337
00:25:12,897 --> 00:25:14,774
God, what were they actually for?

338
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:16,256
I never really thought about it.

339
00:25:16,377 --> 00:25:18,732
Perhaps they were their equivalent
to garden gnomes.

340
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:21,496
Nice try, Simon,
but just a little wide of the mark.

341
00:25:21,697 --> 00:25:24,325
The sphynx was, in fact,
a monster from Greek mythology

342
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,726
with a woman's head.

343
00:25:27,497 --> 00:25:29,886
See? And a lionesse's body
and said--

344
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:35,249
Don't you want to know?
It said riddles to travelers

345
00:25:36,377 --> 00:25:38,572
and killed those who got them wrong.

346
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,450
Just sign right there.

347
00:25:54,617 --> 00:25:57,973
And this is the lease agreement
for the Fifth Avenue apartment.

348
00:25:58,137 --> 00:25:59,252
Yes.

349
00:25:59,377 --> 00:26:01,015
Yes, sign right there.

350
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:04,529
- It's perfectly in order.
- I'm sure it is, but I like to read everything.

351
00:26:05,137 --> 00:26:08,129
Gosh, I never read
a legal document in my life!

352
00:26:08,297 --> 00:26:11,130
- How careless of you.
- It's really straighforward, my dear.

353
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:14,973
- It's just a lot of legal jargon.
- I just sign at the dotted line.

354
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:17,891
Now that can be quite risky,
don't you think?

355
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:20,571
Darling, if you carry on this way
we'll be here all day.

356
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:25,572
- Why don't we... do this later?
- I think it's a very good idea.

357
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,335
It's getting frighfully hot up here.

358
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:32,052
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry, cousin Marie,

359
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:34,731
but I couldn't find it.
- You're a really hopeless creature.

360
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:37,248
I can be rather stupid,
can't I?

361
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:38,730
You most certainly can.

362
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:41,009
Oh, you forgot your magazine.

363
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,853
What is the point of
someone like that?

364
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:50,531
And that rich kid? Signs
a few documents and then has to rest

365
00:26:50,657 --> 00:26:52,170
because it's so frightully hot.

366
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:54,367
And what sets you apart,
<i>Monsieur</i> Ferguson?

367
00:26:54,617 --> 00:26:56,335
I make people aware.

368
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,608
And I certainly don't swan around
like a fop.

369
00:27:01,577 --> 00:27:03,533
Why are you actually here,
<i>Monsieur Poirot</i>?

370
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:05,853
I'm on holiday. And you?

371
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:09,253
I'm studying conditions.

372
00:27:20,257 --> 00:27:21,929
- <i>Monsieur Poirot...
- Madame.

373
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:24,697
I'm so sorry, it's all the motion.

374
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:27,087
I cant seem to find my sea legs.

375
00:27:27,217 --> 00:27:29,094
All this pitching and jolting!

376
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:30,536
I think it would be best if--

377
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:32,727
- Where's that wretched girl?
- You do go back inside, <i>Madame.

378
00:27:32,857 --> 00:27:35,087
Leaving me to suffer,
hour upon hour...

379
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:37,612
God help if we go down,
<i>Monsieur Poirot!

380
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:40,809
The thought of being nibbled
by haddock and carp...

381
00:27:40,937 --> 00:27:44,373
- It is a little too dangerous out here, hm?
- Yes, yes...

382
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:46,773
You might be swept overboard.

383
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:49,730
And end my days in Neptun's arms,

384
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,646
covert in carbuncles
like an old wreck...

385
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:25,011
<i>Non, non, non, non...</i>

386
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:45,888
No doubt it was
a pleasant surprise

387
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:49,168
to run into Linette Doyle
and discover she was married.

388
00:28:49,697 --> 00:28:51,494
Yes. Yes, it was.

389
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:55,533
Well, actually she did write me
about it,

390
00:28:56,697 --> 00:28:58,449
I'd already left
New York,

391
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:01,047
on the Carmanic.
- Oh! The Carmanic?

392
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:02,445
Yes.

393
00:29:02,937 --> 00:29:06,373
Most fortunate then,
that you had with you all of her documents.

394
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:08,692
That's truly none of your business.

395
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:10,639
But, as you mentioned it,

396
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:12,247
I had them sent over
after we met.

397
00:29:13,137 --> 00:29:14,855
Now, if you'll excuse me...

398
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,657
Don't fall on the hole...

399
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:42,451
... the goddess Hathor was often depicted
as the winged cow of creation,

400
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:44,910
who gave birth to the entire universe.

401
00:29:45,031 --> 00:29:46,811
Oh, my! She did keep herself busy.

402
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:49,771
And occasionally, she can be
mistaken for Isis,

403
00:29:49,897 --> 00:29:52,934
magically impregnanted
with the seed of her own son.

404
00:29:53,177 --> 00:29:55,691
- "Heavens to Betsy"!
- Cornelia!

405
00:29:56,977 --> 00:29:58,296
I'm sorry...

406
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:05,375
A nice curvy girl...

407
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:07,894
This is what I like.

408
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:15,200
When are we gonna  see
some more pyramids?

409
00:30:15,322 --> 00:30:17,245
I thought Egypt was full of them.

410
00:30:17,937 --> 00:30:21,213
Let go... we've had enough.
go away, little hauls!

411
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:27,576
Oh! What a wonderful way
to be remembered.

412
00:30:29,217 --> 00:30:31,367
Maybe I'll have one build
in the ground

413
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,006
you can be buried in it, too.
- I'll say!

414
00:30:34,177 --> 00:30:37,294
So we'll give the locals
something to talk about.

415
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:39,400
A-- Aagh!

416
00:30:42,297 --> 00:30:43,650
My God!

417
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:49,293
<i>- Madame, Monsieur</i>...
- Are you hurt?

418
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,287
Isn't that fascinating!

419
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:57,688
The godess Hathor was a beautiful woman
with the head of a cow.

420
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:59,852
Still, I supose that's better than
being a cow

421
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:01,566
with the head of a beautiful woman.

422
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:04,734
This place is simply drenched in
historical goodies like that.

423
00:31:10,697 --> 00:31:12,574
- I thought...
- Yes, <i>Monsieur</i>, I know.

424
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:14,494
I know what you thought.

425
00:31:22,937 --> 00:31:24,734
Tim, what happened?

426
00:32:38,497 --> 00:32:39,816
<i>Bonjour.</i>

427
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:43,091
<i>Pardon... Je ne comprends pas,
Monsieur...</i>

428
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:47,165
Did I fool you?
Poirot, you old dog!

429
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:49,333
- How's tricks?
- Colonel Race!

430
00:32:49,497 --> 00:32:54,093
- I do not believe my eyes! How are you?
- Saddled and flittered.

431
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:57,653
- Otherwise, Tip Top.
- What a big surprise to see you here!

432
00:32:57,777 --> 00:33:01,531
Well, I've been sorting out
a few local difficulties, you know

433
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,847
restless natives, odd assassinations,
that sort of thing.

434
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:06,008
- I say, that's pretty daring.
- <i>Oh! Merci.</i>

435
00:33:06,137 --> 00:33:08,651
You know, you really must give me
the name of your taylor.

436
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:11,809
<i>- Oui</i>. Where are you heading?
-  Back up the river with you.

437
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:14,890
With me? But surely you can go
on a government steamer.

438
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:16,729
In normal circumstances, yes.

439
00:33:16,857 --> 00:33:19,325
But when I heard that my old chum Poirot
was on the vicinities,

440
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:22,847
I thought it would be much more fun.
Something always seem to happen around you.

441
00:33:22,977 --> 00:33:26,253
- It might have already started, <i>mon ami</i>.
- Oh, jolly good!

442
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:31,735
<i>Madame Allerton, Madame Otterbourne,
allow me to introduce a very old friend of mine,</i>

443
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:33,615
<i>Coronel Race.</i>

444
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:02,970
- Miss Robson.
- Where have you been?

445
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:04,815
You're unusually breathless.

446
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,487
And blotchy.

447
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:10,655
I'm sorry, cousin Marie.
I was just outside...

448
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:13,012
And what have you done
with my velvet stole?

449
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:16,693
- Shall I see if it's in the cabin?
- It couldn't possibly be in the cabin.

450
00:34:16,817 --> 00:34:19,411
I had it in here after dinner
and I haven't moved since,

451
00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:21,772
have I, Dr. Bessner?
- No, Miss Van Schuyler.

452
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:24,531
It was on that chair
and it's not now.

453
00:34:24,697 --> 00:34:27,848
- I thought you must have taken it.
- No, I'm afraid I didn't.

454
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:32,171
It was a gift
from </i>Count von Mecklenburg.

455
00:34:36,537 --> 00:34:37,970
Miss Van Schuyler,

456
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:39,731
Miss Robson.

457
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:27,933
<i>Bonne nuit, Mademoiselle.</i>

458
00:35:28,137 --> 00:35:30,890
- You look tired, Monsieur Poirot.
- <i>Oui, oui, c'est vrai.</i>

459
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:32,769
It must, I think, be the heat.

460
00:35:33,577 --> 00:35:34,930
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

Right...

468
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:27,771
- Decided to make a night of it?
- No, no.

469
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,094
I just don't want to bed yet.
It's such a beautiful night.

470
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:33,134
It is lovely, isn't it?

471
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:35,686
Just perfect for a honeymoon.

472
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:41,172
- Two large gins.
- Oh, no! I couldn't.

473
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:42,690
Oh, nonsense!

474
00:36:43,297 --> 00:36:45,174
What's our score, Simon?

475
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,529
Sorry...

476
00:36:48,217 --> 00:36:49,969
We've made 120 below the line.

477
00:36:50,097 --> 00:36:52,247
Not bad looking, don't you think?

478
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,856
Well, I don't know about that...

479
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:57,014
You better watch out,
there are no man-eaters around here.

480
00:36:57,137 --> 00:36:59,412
I'm so sorry,
I suddenly got very tired.

481
00:36:59,537 --> 00:37:01,687
And it is rather rowdy in here.

482
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:04,092
Yes, time to turn in.

483
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:08,687
- Are you coming, Simon?
- I'll...

484
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:11,250
I'll just finish my drink.

485
00:37:17,657 --> 00:37:18,976
Good night.

486
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:25,893
- Well...
- My dear, you didn't have your night cup, yet.

487
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,816
- No...
- We girls must stick together.

488
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:34,135
- I'm absolutely gasping.
- Thank you.

489
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:38,648
To love, marriage,
stuff like that.

490
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:46,730
- Tell me all about yourself.
- Oh, dear!

491
00:37:47,457 --> 00:37:49,652
There isn't really that much to tell.

492
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:54,007
I live at home, in Connecticut.
In a little town, called Bellfield,

493
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:58,889
this is my first trip to Europe
and I'm just loving every minute...

494
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:02,286
- Go on.
- I live with my mother,

495
00:38:02,457 --> 00:38:04,891
whose health is, unfortunately,
a little delicate, at the moment.

496
00:38:05,057 --> 00:38:08,413
She sleeps very badly and she eats
only in the middle day,

497
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,350
some days, just a piece of fruit or two,

498
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:12,451
some days, she'll only touch cereals...

499
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,769
- Do go on.
- Yes, yes. We're all ears.

500
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:19,331
- I really must go to bed.
- Don't go.

501
00:38:19,817 --> 00:38:22,206
- I want to hear more.
- There isn't any more...

502
00:38:22,337 --> 00:38:25,090
- Please.
- Well, I love art,

503
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:30,489
and I go to classes.
I sculpt a little and make pots...

504
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:32,889
Sounds a hoot.

505
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:35,975
- Ring the bell, Simon.
- It's after midnight.

506
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:38,766
- But I need a drink.
- You've had enough.

507
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:40,296
So what?

508
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:49,372
- A bit of fresh air.
- I think it's time...

509
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,607
Don't leave, Cornelia.

510
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:54,851
You see, Simon here is affraid

511
00:38:56,977 --> 00:38:59,172
affraid that I tell you the story
of my life.

512
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:02,289
- Go to bed, Jackie.
- Affraid of a scene, are you?

513
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:04,612
Want me to behave decently,
like you behave to me?

514
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:06,728
Do you really think you can get away
with this?

515
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:08,176
You're drunk.

516
00:39:08,897 --> 00:39:10,933
I said I'd kill you, and by God,
I meant it.

517
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,285
Miss de Bellefort!

518
00:39:12,457 --> 00:39:15,210
I'll shoot you like a dog!
Like the dirty dog you are!

519
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:18,568
Mr. Ferguson! Mr. Ferguson!

520
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:23,610
Good God!

521
00:39:23,817 --> 00:39:25,091
I didn't...

522
00:39:32,097 --> 00:39:33,806
Ferguson, someone's coming.

523
00:39:33,847 --> 00:39:35,807
Tell him it's an accident,
it is nothing.

524
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:42,015
Nothing to worry about.
Charades, that's all.

525
00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:44,973
A game. Fun...

526
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:46,690
Yes... Yes.

527
00:39:50,897 --> 00:39:53,730
Well, I don't think anyone else sould've heard.
It sounded like a cork popping.

528
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:55,967
- What have I done?
- It'll be alright.

529
00:39:56,137 --> 00:39:57,968
Get her out of here, for God's sake,
take her to the cabin!

530
00:39:58,177 --> 00:39:59,690
And don't let her be left alone,
whatever you do!

531
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:02,377
Don't worry, Mr. Doyle.
I'll stay with her.

532
00:40:02,937 --> 00:40:04,928
Get Dr. Bessner
to take a look at this.

533
00:40:05,057 --> 00:40:06,331
I'll kill myself...

534
00:40:06,497 --> 00:40:09,330
Please, please don't let my wife
get wind of this...

535
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:12,014
This way, let's go.
It's alright...

536
00:40:21,497 --> 00:40:24,375
His poor leg... My God,
and if he bleeds to death?

537
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:27,170
Miss de Bellefort,
I don't think that will happen.

538
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:29,612
Let go of me!
I want to drown!

539
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:31,688
That wouldn't solve things.

540
00:40:31,857 --> 00:40:33,734
I'll call Dr. Bessner.

541
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:44,252
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- We need your help! Someting's happenned.

542
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,215
<i>Gott in Himmel!</i>

543
00:40:59,217 --> 00:41:03,415
It is bad. The bone is fractured
and he has lost a lot of blood.

544
00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:07,089
<i>Herr</i> Ferguson, we must take him
to my cabin.

545
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,451
Gently...

546
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,496
Careful...

547
00:41:22,217 --> 00:41:24,128
That's just the best I can do.

548
00:41:24,337 --> 00:41:26,373
You've been a hero, my friend.

549
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:30,696
Now, I will give you something
to help you sleep.

550
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:35,486
- Has anyone told <i>Frau</i> Doyle?
- No. It can wait until tomorrow.

551
00:41:37,377 --> 00:41:40,255
I... You mustn't blame Jackie.
It's my fault.

552
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:43,331
I was a creep.
She didn't know what she was doing.

553
00:41:44,737 --> 00:41:46,693
<i>- Ja, ja</i>.
- She might hurt herself.

554
00:41:49,177 --> 00:41:51,088
Someone ought to stay with her.

555
00:41:51,257 --> 00:41:53,532
It's alright. Miss Robson is with her.

556
00:41:53,657 --> 00:41:55,534
Good...

557
00:41:57,937 --> 00:42:00,929
The pistol.
Can't leave it lying around.

558
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:02,935
Stewards will find it.

559
00:42:03,937 --> 00:42:05,495
I'll get it.

560
00:42:21,297 --> 00:42:23,857
- It's gone.
- Are you sure?

561
00:42:24,097 --> 00:42:27,567
Yes. It dropped out of her hand,
she kicked it under a chair.

562
00:42:27,697 --> 00:42:31,246
- I saw her do it. But it's not there.
- Who could have taken it?

563
00:42:58,217 --> 00:42:59,536
<i>Entrez!</i>

564
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:04,488
Ah! My dear Coronel, what a
beautiful morning, </i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

565
00:43:05,057 --> 00:43:07,093
I'm afraid someone's been shot.

566
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:12,936
- Who?
- Linnet Doyle, last night.

567
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,015
Shot through the head.

568
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:26,215
The pistol was held
close against her head.

569
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,726
- See? Where the skin is scorched?
- <i>Oui.</i>

570
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:32,254
There was no struggle.
She was shot in her sleep.

571
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:33,776
Time of death?

572
00:43:33,937 --> 00:43:37,771
She's certainly been dead six hours,
and probably not longer than eight.

573
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,774
Between twelve and two.

574
00:43:40,897 --> 00:43:44,606
May I ask you, Colonel,
with what authority you make these inquiries?

575
00:43:46,577 --> 00:43:50,570
The Cruise Manager's asked me
to take matters in hands until we reach port.

576
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:53,411
I have some slight official standing,
you see?

577
00:43:53,537 --> 00:43:56,495
- We are all at the disposal of the Coronel.
- Yes, quite.

578
00:43:56,657 --> 00:43:58,932
- Now, what's all that about?
- What? This?

579
00:43:59,057 --> 00:44:01,173
Well, it seems very simple,
does it not?

580
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:03,928
It would appear that she is dying,

581
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:06,935
she writes with her finger
dipped into her own blood,

582
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:09,406
the inicial of the name of the murderer:

583
00:44:10,497 --> 00:44:12,613
Jacqueline de Bellefort,

584
00:44:14,297 --> 00:44:16,936
a young lady who, less than a week ago,
declared to me that:

585
00:44:17,617 --> 00:44:21,371
''I would like nothing better
than to place my gun against her head"

586
00:44:22,377 --> 00:44:24,129
''and, gently, pull the trigger.''

587
00:44:24,257 --> 00:44:26,612
So, I suppose her husband
is next door?

588
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:29,245
At the moment,
he is in my cabin, asleep.

589
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,612
He spent the night in your cabin,
Dr. Bessner?

590
00:44:35,897 --> 00:44:37,953
<i>Ja. Ach.</i> I see you have not heard.

591
00:44:38,982 --> 00:44:39,533
Mr. Doyle was also shot last night.

592
00:44:39,737 --> 00:44:41,375
- What?
- In the leg.

593
00:44:42,337 --> 00:44:43,895
Is there anyone else
we should know about?

594
00:44:44,577 --> 00:44:45,930
That is all.

595
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:49,892
It seems that Mademoiselle de Bellefort
worked herself up, helped by a few drinks,

596
00:44:50,017 --> 00:44:51,735
and finally took a shot at him.

597
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:54,132
The poor man is completely
immobilized.

598
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:56,725
Then she went down to
Linnet Doyle's cabin and shot her as well.

599
00:44:56,857 --> 00:44:58,529
No, no, no, that's not possible.

600
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:00,339
You see, she was
in an hysterical state

601
00:45:00,462 --> 00:45:02,770
and Doyle was most concerned
she should not harm herself,

602
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:05,771
so Miss Robson stayed with her
all night.

603
00:45:05,897 --> 00:45:08,616
- Who discovered the crime?
- It was the maid, apparently, Miss Bourget.

604
00:45:09,537 --> 00:45:12,609
- Coronel, my office is ready for you, sir.
- Thank you.

605
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:15,846
If you could be
as discreet as possible...

606
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:18,127
- It's our speciality, old chap.
- Yes, of course.

607
00:45:19,977 --> 00:45:23,174
Now, we need to speak to Doyle.
You say he's still asleep?

608
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:25,453
I gave him a very strong opiate.

609
00:45:25,777 --> 00:45:29,565
I would suggest I have my breakfast
and then I will see if he's ready to wake.

610
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:33,257
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Colonel.

611
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,806
So, at midnight <i>Madame</i> Doyle
was alive and well.

612
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:41,735
- Yes, I saw her to her cabin.
- Who was remaining in the lounge?

613
00:45:41,897 --> 00:45:45,048
Doyle, Miss de Bellefort,
Miss Robson and myself.

614
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:47,890
- What were you all doing?
- Mr. Ferguson was reading a magazine,

615
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:51,248
and I'd got embroiderie
and Miss de Bellefort was...

616
00:45:51,697 --> 00:45:53,176
- Drinking.
- Yes.

617
00:45:53,537 --> 00:45:54,811
Like a fish.

618
00:45:54,937 --> 00:45:56,733
And I tried to leave once or twice,
but she made me stay

619
00:45:56,862 --> 00:45:58,293
and I was getting
very uncomfortable

620
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:01,215
and so was Mr. Ferguson,
he went out on deck.

621
00:46:01,377 --> 00:46:03,686
It was pretty stuffy in there.

622
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:06,366
Then, Miss de Bellefort
pulled out a pistol

623
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,409
and shot Mr. Doyle in the leg
and I called for Mr. Ferguson.

624
00:46:09,577 --> 00:46:13,013
And Mr. Doyle said not to make a fuss,
then one of the stewards came.

625
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:15,850
And Mr. Ferguson told him
it was all a sort of a game

626
00:46:16,017 --> 00:46:19,726
and then Miss de Bellefort started to cry
and so we took her to her cabin.

627
00:46:20,017 --> 00:46:22,736
And I stayed with her,
while Mr. Ferguson got Dr. Bessner.

628
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:25,166
- At what time was this?
- Mercy, I don't know.

629
00:46:25,457 --> 00:46:27,209
About twenty past twelve,

630
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:30,097
because it was half past
when I finally turned in.

631
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:33,055
And you are quite sure that
Mademoiselle de Bellefort did not leave the cabin?

632
00:46:33,177 --> 00:46:34,405
Positive.

633
00:46:34,537 --> 00:46:38,132
And she couldn't have shot Mrs. Doyle
before, let's say at twenty past twelve?

634
00:46:39,617 --> 00:46:41,847
How long did you remain with her,
Mademoiselle Robson?

635
00:46:42,017 --> 00:46:44,247
Well, I was with her all night.
She never woke once.

636
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:46,049
I think it was probably the drink.

637
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:48,054
<i>Bien</i>. So far,
she has the alibi <i>parfait.</i>

638
00:46:48,177 --> 00:46:49,521
And <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle,
I understand,

639
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,374
was most anxious
that she should not be left alone.

640
00:46:51,497 --> 00:46:54,534
Yes, he was quite worried
that she might do something stupid.

641
00:46:54,977 --> 00:46:57,445
She even said that she wanted
to kill herself.

642
00:46:57,577 --> 00:46:58,935
And the pistol?

643
00:46:59,062 --> 00:47:00,649
- What happenned to that?
- She dropped it.

644
00:47:00,857 --> 00:47:02,973
And kicked it under a chair,

645
00:47:03,297 --> 00:47:04,730
but when I went to get it,

646
00:47:05,937 --> 00:47:07,290
it'd gone.

647
00:47:09,657 --> 00:47:11,215
Gone?

648
00:47:13,217 --> 00:47:15,333
Now we begin to arrive.

649
00:47:16,257 --> 00:47:18,407
You are quite certain
that <i>Mademoiselle de Bellefort

650
00:47:18,537 --> 00:47:20,528
did not recover it
before she left the lounge?

651
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:22,056
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

652
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:25,214
And she had no opportunity
of returning to retrieve it.

653
00:47:25,337 --> 00:47:27,168
So how long was it between the time

654
00:47:27,337 --> 00:47:30,329
that you and you and Dr. Bessner
carried <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle out to the cabin

655
00:47:30,457 --> 00:47:32,413
and when you returned to look
for the pistol?

656
00:47:32,537 --> 00:47:34,175
- Five minutes?
- Five minutes.

657
00:47:34,297 --> 00:47:35,859
In those five minutes,
someone removed the pistol

658
00:47:35,892 --> 00:47:38,609
and that someone
was not <i>Jacqueline de Bellefort.

659
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:44,320
Then we may assume
that this person has overheard

660
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:46,368
or seen
some of the events preceeding.

661
00:47:47,177 --> 00:47:49,054
- But how d'you made that up?
- Because you told us

662
00:47:49,177 --> 00:47:52,408
that the pistol was out of sight,
so it could hardly be discovered by accident.

663
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:54,932
Well, I saw no one on the deck
before the shot was fired.

664
00:47:55,057 --> 00:47:57,412
- On which side were you, Monsieur?
- Starboard, I think.

665
00:47:57,537 --> 00:48:00,529
So, if someone was on the port side,
you could not have seen them.

666
00:48:01,697 --> 00:48:02,812
No, I suppose not.

667
00:48:02,937 --> 00:48:04,928
Did anyone hear the shot,
appart from the steward?

668
00:48:05,057 --> 00:48:06,331
I doubt it,

669
00:48:06,457 --> 00:48:08,175
it sounded like a cork popping,
anyway.

670
00:48:08,297 --> 00:48:10,857
Did you hear anything at all,
after retiring?

671
00:48:11,217 --> 00:48:14,334
I think a heard a kind of ...splash,
just as I was dropping--

672
00:48:14,497 --> 00:48:15,896
What time would that be?

673
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:18,253
What's the French for
''third degree''?

674
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:22,926
- Just answer the question.
- 1 h? 12:55? 1:05?

675
00:48:23,097 --> 00:48:25,053
Who knows?
Now, would that be all?

676
00:48:26,177 --> 00:48:28,645
Hm? Oh-- yes?
Thank you, <i>Monsieur</i>, for your help.

677
00:48:30,937 --> 00:48:32,416
By the way...

678
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:39,332
- Who exactly are you?
- What a damn fool question!

679
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:42,328
Heat's getting too much for you,
is it?

680
00:48:42,457 --> 00:48:45,415
Hm? No, but thank you
for your concern.

681
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,168
What a fightfully rude young man!

682
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:51,807
Oh, one thing more, <i>Mademoiselle...

683
00:48:51,832 --> 00:48:53,807
had you ever met <i>Madame</i> Doyle
before this trip?

684
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:57,926
- No. Never.
- Merci.

685
00:48:59,577 --> 00:49:00,930
Good day.

686
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:04,891
I-I didn't do it,
you must believe me.

687
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:09,772
I was in such a state, I could
have killed Simon, but I didn't do it.

688
00:49:09,937 --> 00:49:11,131
There, there...

689
00:49:11,297 --> 00:49:13,049
We know , <i>Mademoiselle.

690
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:16,850
- You do?
- Oh yes, it is proved, <i>mon enfant,</i>

691
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:19,169
it was not you.

692
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,336
Oh! Thank God for that!

693
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:25,888
- So, who was it?
- Ah! That is where we need help.

694
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:30,528
I can't think of anyone
who wanted her dead, except for me.

695
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:34,089
I wanted her dead,
and she is dead.

696
00:49:35,457 --> 00:49:38,290
- And she died just like I said.
- <i>Oui</i>. Shot through the head.

697
00:49:42,777 --> 00:49:46,133
See? I was right. There was someone
listening that night, at the hotel.

698
00:49:46,937 --> 00:49:49,895
- Who could it have been?
- Are you certain it was a man?

699
00:49:51,937 --> 00:49:55,168
No, I just assumed.

700
00:49:56,097 --> 00:49:57,416
<i>Entrez.</i>

701
00:49:58,217 --> 00:50:01,129
- Doyle is ready to see you now.
- Is he alright?

702
00:50:02,097 --> 00:50:04,691
Of course he's not alright,
you shot him.

703
00:50:05,857 --> 00:50:07,495
He's not going to die, is he?

704
00:50:07,657 --> 00:50:09,648
He has the constitution of a peasant.

705
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:13,765
We will get him to civilization,
where he'll have an x-ray and proper treatment.

706
00:50:18,297 --> 00:50:21,846
We now know that it was not <i>Jacqueline
de Bellefort</i> who shot your wife,

707
00:50:22,337 --> 00:50:24,345
so, can you give to us any idea

708
00:50:24,386 --> 00:50:26,616
of who you think that might have been?

709
00:50:29,577 --> 00:50:32,649
Did she have any enemies
or someone who bore against her the grudge?

710
00:50:35,257 --> 00:50:36,849
You see, Monsieur Doyle,

711
00:50:38,697 --> 00:50:42,053
on the first day of the cruise, I had
a little encounter with your wife.

712
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:46,490
She was upset.
She said that everybody,

713
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:52,167
everybody, mark you, hated her
and she was surrounded by enemies.

714
00:50:52,937 --> 00:50:54,515
Now, she was exaggerating,

715
00:50:54,566 --> 00:50:57,216
but she did mean
more than one person.

716
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:01,571
There was a name,
on the passenger list...

717
00:51:02,497 --> 00:51:06,536
- So, what name was that?
- She did next to tell me.

718
00:51:08,617 --> 00:51:10,972
You see, her father
played the markets

719
00:51:11,577 --> 00:51:13,932
several people got it in the neck.

720
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:17,454
Rolling in it one day,
and in the gutter the next.

721
00:51:18,217 --> 00:51:21,368
Someone on board
whose father was one of those,

722
00:51:22,057 --> 00:51:24,127
had it in for Linnet's old man.

723
00:51:27,697 --> 00:51:30,609
She said how awful it was,
everyone hating her

724
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:33,328
without even knowing her.

725
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:36,814
She did not mention a name?

726
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:54,935
Tell me, <i>Mademoiselle Bourget,</i>

727
00:51:55,057 --> 00:51:57,412
what time was it,
when you last saw alive your mistress?

728
00:51:57,577 --> 00:52:00,216
- Sometime after midnight, <i>Monsieur</i>.
- And what then?

729
00:52:00,857 --> 00:52:03,849
- Then I went to my cabin, <i>Monsieur</i>.
- You heard or saw anything?

730
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:06,770
- How could I?
- Well, that is for you to say, Mademoiselle.

731
00:52:07,097 --> 00:52:09,850
My cabin is on the deck below,
on the other side.

732
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,607
It is not possible I should hear anything,

733
00:52:13,657 --> 00:52:15,568
unless I could not sleep,

734
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:18,854
and came back up.
Then, perhaps I see something,

735
00:52:19,257 --> 00:52:22,454
this monster enter or leave
my mistress' cabin.

736
00:52:24,297 --> 00:52:28,051
Then-- <i>Monsieur</i>, I implore you!
You know as it is... what can I say?

737
00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:29,769
Calm down, for Heaven's sake!

738
00:52:32,137 --> 00:52:34,890
It'll be alright.
I'll look after you.

739
00:52:35,297 --> 00:52:37,128
Nobody's accusing you of anything.

740
00:52:38,377 --> 00:52:40,049
<i>Monsieur</i> is very good.

741
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:43,170
Do you know anyone who-- had a grudge
against your mistress?

742
00:52:43,337 --> 00:52:46,693
<i>Non, Monsieur</i>.
Everybody loved her.

743
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,615
Tell me, <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle,

744
00:52:48,857 --> 00:52:51,769
did your wife have with her, on this cruise
any jewelry that was valuable?

745
00:52:52,097 --> 00:52:55,134
- The pearls.
- Do you know anything about these pearls?

746
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,130
- She was wearing them last night.
- But did you see them when you went to bed?

747
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:00,293
- Yes, <i>Monsieur</i>.
- And where she put them?

748
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:03,296
- On her bedside table.
- And where they this morning?

749
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,294
I did not see, because when
I come into the room

750
00:53:07,777 --> 00:53:10,166
the only thing I notice was <i>Madame...

751
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:13,295
... dead.
- <i>Oui bien, Mademoiselle</i>, but I did see

752
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:17,614
and there were no pearls
on her bedside table this morning.

753
00:53:18,857 --> 00:53:20,415
<i>Merci.</i>

754
00:53:22,057 --> 00:53:25,129
I think I heard a splash
and someone running.

755
00:53:25,657 --> 00:53:26,976
Or was it the other way about?

756
00:53:27,177 --> 00:53:30,567
- Do you know what time that was?
- An hour after I went to bed?

757
00:53:31,217 --> 00:53:33,492
Or maybe more,
I can't be sure.

758
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,407
- Did you ever met <i>Madame</i> Doyle before?
- No,

759
00:53:36,737 --> 00:53:40,491
but I'd heard a lot about her
through a relative of ours, Joanna Southwood.

760
00:53:40,777 --> 00:53:44,008
And through Tim, of course,
who had met her.

761
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,487
One more question, </i>Madame.

762
00:53:50,657 --> 00:53:52,648
Did your family ever suffer
financially

763
00:53:52,777 --> 00:53:54,688
with the dealings of the father
of Madame Doyle?

764
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:59,049
No. The family finances never
suffered except by dwindling.

765
00:53:59,617 --> 00:54:01,892
Our poverty has never been
melodramatic.

766
00:54:03,097 --> 00:54:04,894
I was woken by lots of different voices,

767
00:54:05,057 --> 00:54:07,287
then somebody running
along the deck,

768
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:08,930
then a splash.

769
00:54:09,857 --> 00:54:12,007
You sure it was not a shot
that you heard?

770
00:54:12,697 --> 00:54:14,369
It might have been.

771
00:54:14,897 --> 00:54:16,853
I did hear a cork pop.

772
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:19,936
Perhaps that was the shot
and I imagined the splash.

773
00:54:20,097 --> 00:54:23,726
You know, sort of association,
a cork popping, liquid splashing...

774
00:54:23,857 --> 00:54:26,132
- And after that?
- Oblivion.

775
00:54:34,577 --> 00:54:37,011
I heard somebody on the deck
and then a splash.

776
00:54:37,217 --> 00:54:40,687
- Do you know what time this was?
- 01:10. I looked in my clock.

777
00:54:40,817 --> 00:54:43,411
- You did not hear a shot?
- No, I did not.

778
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:46,575
Have you any idea
of what might have caused the splash?

779
00:54:46,697 --> 00:54:48,289
- Oh, yes.
- You do?

780
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:50,328
I know exactly what it was.

781
00:54:50,977 --> 00:54:52,992
I went to the door of my cabin.

782
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:55,732
The daughter of that hedious woman
in the turban

783
00:54:56,217 --> 00:55:01,245
was leaning over the rail,
she just dropped something into the water.

784
00:55:01,737 --> 00:55:04,376
- You quite sure?
- Why else would I have said it?

785
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:07,895
- Yes?
- We've found it, Colonel.

786
00:55:15,697 --> 00:55:17,016
Good job.

787
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,528
Is this the gun
you saw at the hotel?

788
00:55:24,497 --> 00:55:25,816
Yes, it is.

789
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:31,771
Two shots fired.
This must be the weapon.

790
00:55:31,977 --> 00:55:34,650
What about my stole?
Look at the state of it!

791
00:55:35,137 --> 00:55:36,650
Where did you last see this?

792
00:55:36,817 --> 00:55:39,251
- I had it in the lounge, yesterday evening.
- Please, do observe.

793
00:55:40,651 --> 00:55:42,057
<i>Hélas!</i>

794
00:55:42,857 --> 00:55:47,612
So, the murderer must have used this
as a silencer.

795
00:55:48,297 --> 00:55:50,015
The impertinence!

796
00:55:51,137 --> 00:55:54,049
Er... Miss Van Schuyler,
would you excuse us, please?

797
00:55:56,257 --> 00:55:59,727
Count Van Mecklamburg
will be most displeased.

798
00:56:07,777 --> 00:56:10,007
<i>Non, non</i>! It does not make sense!

799
00:56:12,097 --> 00:56:15,373
If the murderer wishes us to believe
that <i>Jaqueline de Bellefort</i> is the culprit,

800
00:56:15,537 --> 00:56:18,768
why throw the revolver,
the evidence the most accusing of all,

801
00:56:19,137 --> 00:56:20,695
into the River Nile?

802
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,969
I told you, I never left my cabin.

803
00:56:25,097 --> 00:56:27,770
Well, that is strange, <i>Mademoiselle</i>,
because someone said that saw you.

804
00:56:27,897 --> 00:56:29,728
- Who?
- Mademoiselle Van Schuyler.

805
00:56:30,017 --> 00:56:32,577
She looked outside her cabin,
and saw you throwing something over the side.

806
00:56:32,737 --> 00:56:35,649
- And what else did she claim to have seen?
- Nothing,

807
00:56:36,737 --> 00:56:40,252
but she heard something: someone
moving about the cabin of <i>Madame Doyle.

808
00:56:40,417 --> 00:56:41,374
Of course, <i>mademoiselle,

809
00:56:41,412 --> 00:56:42,982
there might be a reason
that is perfectly innocent

810
00:56:43,137 --> 00:56:44,329
for throwing something overboard.

811
00:56:44,497 --> 00:56:46,408
But, then again...

812
00:56:53,937 --> 00:56:56,292
- Is that what she was killed with?
- <i>Oui, mademoiselle.</i>

813
00:56:57,297 --> 00:56:59,128
Hmm... And you think
that I might have done it?

814
00:56:59,297 --> 00:57:01,811
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Van Schuyler
is prepared to swear

815
00:57:01,937 --> 00:57:04,212
that she saw you quite clearly
in the moonlight.

816
00:57:05,017 --> 00:57:07,212
<i><b>It  wasn't me.</b></i>

817
00:57:09,737 --> 00:57:11,534
I was dead to the world...

818
00:57:11,697 --> 00:57:14,052
... like poor Madame Doyle
is now, in fact.

819
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:17,055
A <i>crime passionnel,</i>
wouldn't you say, <i>Monsieur Poirot?</i>

820
00:57:17,577 --> 00:57:21,775
That girl, Jacqueline, half latin,
you know, creeping along the deck,

821
00:57:22,097 --> 00:57:26,613
pistol in full cock.
Or Mr. Doyle, deranged by desire,

822
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:29,885
lust pumping through his veins.

823
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:34,815
Or perhaps Miss Robson,
the repressed virgin, tragically plain,

824
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:39,409
driven to distraction by the proximity
of honeymoon passion...

825
00:57:42,697 --> 00:57:45,783
Tell me, <i>Monsieur</i> Pennington,
are you aware of anyone

826
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:47,697
who wished to see
Madame Doyle dead?

827
00:57:51,297 --> 00:57:54,972
Well, there is that Madam,
that Miss <i>de Bellefort</i>.

828
00:57:56,417 --> 00:57:59,568
- Now, if looks could kill...
- Thank you for that, <i>Monsieur.

829
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:04,208
You may, perhaps also recall that
<i>Madame</i> Doyle had a very near escape,

830
00:58:04,337 --> 00:58:06,487
at the temple of Hathor.
- Well, I did hear about that,

831
00:58:08,257 --> 00:58:10,532
but I was inside the temple
at the time.

832
00:58:10,857 --> 00:58:13,555
Mr. Doyle mentioned that
there was someone on board

833
00:58:13,662 --> 00:58:15,806
who bore a grudge against her family.

834
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:19,049
- Do you know who that could be?
- I'm afraid I don't.

835
00:58:19,177 --> 00:58:21,771
No business dealings of her father
that might have resulted

836
00:58:21,937 --> 00:58:24,656
in ruin for some rival?

837
00:58:25,497 --> 00:58:27,567
Not that I am aware of, no.

838
00:58:39,457 --> 00:58:42,608
So, why should the murderer
take the stole before the event?

839
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:45,811
After all, nobody knew that
<i>Mademoiselle de Bellefort

840
00:58:45,937 --> 00:58:48,326
<i>et Monsieur Doyle</i>
were going to... have a scene.

841
00:58:49,297 --> 00:58:52,095
Perhaps he found it
when he went in to get the pistol.

842
00:58:52,217 --> 00:58:55,015
Why was it not discovered
when the search for it was made?

843
00:58:55,897 --> 00:58:58,286
<i>Non, non, my friend,
it makes no sense.</i>

844
00:58:59,377 --> 00:59:01,686
Well, don't be downhearted.
We'll get to the bottom of it.

845
00:59:01,817 --> 00:59:03,455
Oh, I know I will!

846
00:59:06,937 --> 00:59:09,497
Doyle has asked if he may see
Mademoiselle de Bellefort.

847
00:59:11,057 --> 00:59:13,048
<i>- Oui, I will bring her to him.
- Very good.</i>

848
00:59:17,777 --> 00:59:20,291
Did you know that Monsieur Pennington
told to us a lie?

849
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:21,566
Did he?

850
00:59:21,737 --> 00:59:25,446
He said that he was in the temple
when the statuette fell. He was not.

851
00:59:25,737 --> 00:59:28,251
I had just come from there myself.

852
00:59:35,017 --> 00:59:36,370
Come in.

853
00:59:43,977 --> 00:59:45,783
I thought you might be worrying,

854
00:59:45,822 --> 00:59:48,495
and I wanted you to know that it's--
it's alright.

855
00:59:50,617 --> 00:59:52,653
I behaved absolutely rotten
to you.

856
00:59:54,937 --> 00:59:56,734
Oh! Simon, I'm so sorry...

857
00:59:58,417 --> 01:00:00,487
I'm so sorry...

858
01:00:12,987 --> 01:00:14,876
How could you do this to me?
How could you?

859
01:00:14,932 --> 01:00:16,176
You know I need it!

860
01:00:16,337 --> 01:00:18,168
- It's for your own good, mother.
- Ungrateful wretch!

861
01:00:18,297 --> 01:00:20,857
- Have you any idea how I suffer?
- You don't let me forget!

862
01:00:23,497 --> 01:00:26,170
Mademoiselle,
may I have a few words?

863
01:00:28,017 --> 01:00:29,735
I won't "beat about the bushes",

864
01:00:29,857 --> 01:00:32,132
<i>but your mother, she drinks,
n'est-ce pas?</i>

865
01:00:32,497 --> 01:00:34,328
No need for you to talk.

866
01:00:34,657 --> 01:00:36,473
When I first met you,
I saw at once

867
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:38,413
that you were protecting her
from something

868
01:00:38,977 --> 01:00:41,047
and soon I discovered
what that something was.

869
01:00:41,977 --> 01:00:44,445
The secret drinker, with the secret
cunning of the drunken,

870
01:00:44,577 --> 01:00:46,568
had a secret supply hidden away.

871
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:49,293
I believe that you yesterday discovered
her supply

872
01:00:49,697 --> 01:00:52,165
and, while your mother was
sound asleep,

873
01:00:52,457 --> 01:00:55,494
you threw overboard the bottles.
I am right, am I not?

874
01:00:56,377 --> 01:00:58,253
It all began when her books
stopped selling

875
01:00:58,302 --> 01:01:00,053
and that hurt her dreadfully.

876
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:02,374
She made a complete fool of herself,

877
01:01:03,257 --> 01:01:04,770
it was awful.

878
01:01:05,217 --> 01:01:09,176
I had to keep my eye on her all the time.
And she began to hate me.

879
01:01:09,977 --> 01:01:12,445
<i>- Pauvre petite.
- Don't pity me, for God's sake!</i>

880
01:01:15,337 --> 01:01:18,488
I know people think
I'm stuck-up, bad tempered,

881
01:01:18,657 --> 01:01:21,410
but the truth is, I forgot
how to be nice.

882
01:01:24,217 --> 01:01:26,173
You won't tell anyone, will you?

883
01:01:26,297 --> 01:01:30,734
<i>Non, but now I need you to tell me
what I need to know.</i>

884
01:01:32,097 --> 01:01:34,611
At what time did you throw
overboard the bottles?

885
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:38,088
- At 01:10, perhaps?
- About that, yes.

886
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,999
As I have already told you,

887
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:42,689
Mademoiselle Van Schuyler
saw you from her cabin door.

888
01:01:42,977 --> 01:01:44,729
Now you tell me: did you see her?

889
01:01:45,257 --> 01:01:49,045
No, I didn't. I looked along the deck,
out to the river.

890
01:01:49,337 --> 01:01:51,805
But did you see anyone,
when you looked along the deck?

891
01:01:52,097 --> 01:01:53,849
Anyone at all?

892
01:01:54,137 --> 01:01:56,697
No, I saw nobody.

893
01:01:58,657 --> 01:01:59,885
<i>Merci.</i>

894
01:02:24,017 --> 01:02:25,052
Stolen?

895
01:02:25,217 --> 01:02:28,368
- I'm afraid it is so, Madame.
- Those beautiful pearls!

896
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,051
Remember that party
at the Portarlington's,

897
01:02:32,177 --> 01:02:33,974
when poor Lady Hooper's diamonds
were stolen?

898
01:02:34,097 --> 01:02:36,611
The Police gave you
quite a grilling.

899
01:02:44,777 --> 01:02:47,974
Poor child!
She looks dreadfully unhappy.

900
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,452
Well, she shouldn't go around
shooting people.

901
01:02:50,577 --> 01:02:52,886
I mean, who does she think she is,
Annie Oakley?

902
01:02:53,817 --> 01:02:56,411
French have blood on their hands,
we have blood on our hands

903
01:02:56,537 --> 01:02:58,767
and one day we'll all pay for all
dearly, I tell you!

904
01:02:58,937 --> 01:03:00,734
Yeah, and I tell you
to shut up and eat!

905
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:02,854
Why couldn't you wait for me?

906
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:05,016
I had something to do.

907
01:03:05,177 --> 01:03:07,645
I remember reading
about the diamonds of Lady Hooper.

908
01:03:07,777 --> 01:03:10,928
Well... As usual, mother has got
the whole thing hopelessly wrong.

909
01:03:11,217 --> 01:03:14,766
I wasn't there when they're actually
stolen, just when it was discovered

910
01:03:15,097 --> 01:03:18,294
that the old bag was wearing
paste around her fat neck.

911
01:03:19,977 --> 01:03:23,492
Some say she was in on it
herself.

912
01:03:24,257 --> 01:03:27,408
- Joanna, no doubt.
- Joanna wasn't there, mother.

913
01:03:27,577 --> 01:03:29,056
If I may have your attention...

914
01:03:30,737 --> 01:03:34,176
It's come to our notice that
a valuable string of pearls,

915
01:03:34,237 --> 01:03:36,355
belonging to the late Mrs. Doyle,
is gone missing.

916
01:03:36,475 --> 01:03:37,594
What?

917
01:03:37,737 --> 01:03:39,773
A search in the boat is just about
to take place.

918
01:03:39,897 --> 01:03:42,775
I'd be grateful if you would all
remain here until it's completed.

919
01:03:42,897 --> 01:03:44,573
And thereafter, I'd be most grateful

920
01:03:44,742 --> 01:03:47,254
if you'd all submit yourselves
to a search.

921
01:03:57,677 --> 01:03:59,872
Sir, there is a lady that says
it's urgent

922
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,752
she speak to you.

923
01:04:02,977 --> 01:04:05,207
- Bring her in.
- Please.

924
01:04:08,217 --> 01:04:09,696
<i>- Miss Robson.
-  Mademoiselle.</i>

925
01:04:09,817 --> 01:04:11,409
What can we do for you?

926
01:04:16,777 --> 01:04:21,055
- You took them?
- No, I didn't. Cousin Marie did.

927
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:24,771
<i>- Mademoiselle Van Schuyler?
- She can't help it.</i>

928
01:04:24,897 --> 01:04:26,082
It's her little idiosyncrasy.

929
01:04:26,122 --> 01:04:28,685
That's why I'm here,
to keep an eye on her.

930
01:04:29,017 --> 01:04:32,646
- Where did you find them?
- They were on her stokings,this morning.

931
01:04:33,257 --> 01:04:36,693
That's where she usually hides things.
I knew whose they were, of course,

932
01:04:37,057 --> 01:04:38,730
so I went along to return them,

933
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,130
<i>but there was a steward en garde,
who told me about the murder.</i>

934
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:43,074
I've been in absolute stale all morning.

935
01:04:43,134 --> 01:04:45,774
The Van Schuylers, you see,
are very particular.

936
01:04:46,097 --> 01:04:49,055
I mean, it would never do
if this got into the papers.

937
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:51,890
- But it won't, will it?
- Well, it depends, Miss Robson.

938
01:04:52,017 --> 01:04:53,416
<i>Non, non, non, non, non...</i>

939
01:04:53,577 --> 01:04:56,489
<i>We shall do our very best for you,
of course, Mademoiselle.</i>

940
01:04:57,017 --> 01:04:58,973
- Thank you so much.
- Please.

941
01:04:59,537 --> 01:05:00,811
<i>Thank you, Monsieur...</i>

942
01:05:07,257 --> 01:05:08,485
Poirot.

943
01:05:21,337 --> 01:05:23,293
Imitation, my friend.

944
01:05:23,817 --> 01:05:26,695
Now we begin our search
for the real thing.

945
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:30,492
I doubt we will find them
in Mrs. Doyle's cabin.

946
01:05:30,617 --> 01:05:33,131
We never know what
we might find, Colonel.

947
01:05:55,737 --> 01:05:58,729
''Das Kapital''...
Conrad Ferguson is a bolschie.

948
01:06:00,857 --> 01:06:03,451
I always knew there was
something fishy about the chap.

949
01:06:15,217 --> 01:06:17,447
A bolschie is not all that he is...

950
01:06:18,817 --> 01:06:21,456
Monsieur Allerton, it would seem,
is most religious.

951
01:06:27,337 --> 01:06:30,693
The glue... Now, what would he
want with this, I wonder?

952
01:06:33,097 --> 01:06:34,576
Well, I dunno...

953
01:06:46,057 --> 01:06:49,015
<i>Monsieur Pennington.
S.S. Normandie.</i>

954
01:06:53,137 --> 01:06:54,456
Poirot.

955
01:07:07,577 --> 01:07:09,932
The passengers have been
searched, sir.

956
01:07:10,097 --> 01:07:11,849
- And...?
- Nothing,

957
01:07:11,977 --> 01:07:14,286
except for Miss Rosalie Otterbourne,

958
01:07:14,537 --> 01:07:17,495
there was a small revolver
in her handbag.

959
01:07:17,737 --> 01:07:20,297
- So, how did she react?
- She did not notice.

960
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:22,931
I had my back turned to her,
at the time.

961
01:07:23,337 --> 01:07:25,851
And still there is one person
we have not searched.

962
01:07:25,977 --> 01:07:28,332
- Who's that?
- The maid, Louise Bourget.

963
01:07:28,497 --> 01:07:30,727
We can not find her
anywhere.

964
01:07:50,037 --> 01:07:52,520
Dead not more than an hour.
Instantaneous.

965
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,494
Stabbed through the heart.

966
01:07:54,897 --> 01:07:56,171
With what?

967
01:07:56,337 --> 01:07:57,816
With something like this.

968
01:07:57,937 --> 01:08:00,167
I supose that none of your knives
is missing.

969
01:08:00,297 --> 01:08:02,492
<i>Do you think I would kill a little
miserable femme de chambre?</i>

970
01:08:02,657 --> 01:08:03,976
No, I just wondered...

971
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,647
All my knives are
present and correct.

972
01:08:06,777 --> 01:08:07,926
Good, good.

973
01:08:08,057 --> 01:08:10,048
Well, now if you'll excuse me...

974
01:08:17,977 --> 01:08:19,456
She was holding this.

975
01:08:19,737 --> 01:08:21,693
It's the corner of
one thousand franc note.

976
01:08:22,137 --> 01:08:24,173
What did she say
when we questioned her?

977
01:08:26,817 --> 01:08:28,534
''It is not possible that I should
hear anything,

978
01:08:28,554 --> 01:08:29,994
"unless I could not sleep

979
01:08:30,057 --> 01:08:32,810
''and came back up.
Then perhaps I see something,

980
01:08:32,937 --> 01:08:36,407
''this monster enter or leave
my mistresse's cabin.''

981
01:08:36,577 --> 01:08:39,330
This is exactly what happenned!
She did return to the top deck.

982
01:08:39,457 --> 01:08:41,527
She did someone enter
or leave the cabin.

983
01:08:41,657 --> 01:08:43,409
- Blackmail.
- Yes. So the murdered enters,

984
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:46,370
gives to her the money,
and, while she is counting it...

985
01:08:56,897 --> 01:08:58,967
<i>You talk the scandal,
mesdemoiselles?</i>

986
01:08:59,097 --> 01:09:01,053
We were just comparing lipsticks.

987
01:09:02,617 --> 01:09:06,371
<i>- What's wrong, Monsieur Poirot?
- The maid of Madame Doyle</i>

988
01:09:07,737 --> 01:09:09,773
she has been killed.
- Louise?

989
01:09:10,177 --> 01:09:12,372
She saw something she was not
meant to see.

990
01:09:12,537 --> 01:09:13,765
What?

991
01:09:13,897 --> 01:09:16,695
Someone enter or leave the cabin
of Madame Doyle last night.

992
01:09:16,817 --> 01:09:18,045
Did she say who?

993
01:09:18,177 --> 01:09:19,815
Miss Jacqueline, if you please,
do excuse us.

994
01:09:19,937 --> 01:09:21,131
Oh! Of course.

995
01:09:33,457 --> 01:09:35,846
- Why did you not tell me the truth?
- I have.

996
01:09:35,977 --> 01:09:39,208
<i>Non, you did not tell me everything
you saw last night.</i>

997
01:09:39,337 --> 01:09:41,976
And you did not tell me that you have
in your handbag, the little revolver.

998
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:43,650
I don't!

999
01:10:04,457 --> 01:10:06,573
- I want the truth!
- And what is the truth?

1000
01:10:06,697 --> 01:10:09,257
That you saw last night someone come out
of the cabin of Linnet Doyle.

1001
01:10:09,377 --> 01:10:11,095
I'm right, am I not, Mademoiselle?

1002
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:13,287
I've told you I saw no one!

1003
01:10:36,897 --> 01:10:39,411
You're not thinking of jumping in,
are you, old chap?

1004
01:10:39,537 --> 01:10:41,334
Why would I want to do that,

1005
01:10:41,857 --> 01:10:44,417
just when things begin to
fall into place?

1006
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:49,411
Just a few questions,
that is all, Doctor.

1007
01:10:51,817 --> 01:10:54,570
I'll return in three minutes,
then positively you go.

1008
01:10:54,857 --> 01:10:56,210
<i>Merci.</i>

1009
01:10:59,897 --> 01:11:02,092
<i>I will not detain you for long,
Monsieur Doyle.</i>

1010
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:03,445
So, what is it?

1011
01:11:03,577 --> 01:11:05,807
<i>Monsieur Poirot!
Monsieur Poirot!</i>

1012
01:11:06,897 --> 01:11:09,270
Monsieur Poirot, I must speak with you,

1013
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,971
I have vital information!

1014
01:11:12,057 --> 01:11:15,015
- I know who killed Linnet Doyle!
- What?

1015
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:18,768
<i>- Yes, and I have evidence to prove it!
- S'il vous plaît, Madame.</i>

1016
01:11:19,377 --> 01:11:22,414
<i>Merci. My theories
about primeval urges</i>

1017
01:11:22,937 --> 01:11:24,734
are completely justified.

1018
01:11:25,457 --> 01:11:28,017
You will agree that
whoever killed Louise,

1019
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:31,090
what's her name,
also killed Linnet Doyle?

1020
01:11:31,897 --> 01:11:33,933
I saw the person
with my own eyes.

1021
01:11:34,057 --> 01:11:35,968
You saw the person
who killed my wife?

1022
01:11:36,017 --> 01:11:37,612
It was just before lunch.

1023
01:11:37,642 --> 01:11:39,812
I had an arrangement with
one of the "ship's personnel"

1024
01:11:40,097 --> 01:11:42,292
to get me...
something I needed,

1025
01:11:42,457 --> 01:11:44,129
we were to meet on the
lower deck.

1026
01:11:44,497 --> 01:11:46,787
As I walked along,
a cabin door opened

1027
01:11:46,857 --> 01:11:50,389
and this girl, Louise...
Budget?...

1028
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,250
popped her head out.

1029
01:11:52,357 --> 01:11:54,593
I think she was expecting someone,
but when she saw it was me,

1030
01:11:54,613 --> 01:11:56,493
she darted back inside.

1031
01:11:56,657 --> 01:11:59,217
I thought nothing of it,
of course went along,

1032
01:11:59,457 --> 01:12:02,335
got the-- from the man, and started
back. Just as I did,

1033
01:12:02,457 --> 01:12:06,814
I saw someone knock on the...
maids door and go inside!

1034
01:12:08,297 --> 01:12:09,525
Yes?

1035
01:12:10,177 --> 01:12:11,246
Yes!

1036
01:12:11,617 --> 01:12:14,006
- But who was it?
- Didn't I say?

1037
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:16,770
It was...

1038
01:12:28,097 --> 01:12:29,246
What the devil was that?

1039
01:12:29,377 --> 01:12:31,049
- Did you see anyone?
- No.

1040
01:12:31,857 --> 01:12:34,929
That's Pennington's gun.
I saw him cleaning it the other day.

1041
01:12:41,097 --> 01:12:43,053
So, how do you account
for your gun being used?

1042
01:12:43,177 --> 01:12:45,168
- I have no idea.
- Was anybody aware that you had one?

1043
01:12:45,297 --> 01:12:46,696
I made no secret of it.

1044
01:12:46,857 --> 01:12:48,051
Tell me, Monsieur Pennington,

1045
01:12:48,177 --> 01:12:50,737
Linnet Doyle was not yet
of age when she married, yes?

1046
01:12:50,857 --> 01:12:52,415
She would turn 21 next July.

1047
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:54,368
Which is when she would have
taken control of her fortune?

1048
01:12:54,497 --> 01:12:56,089
According of her father's will,

1049
01:12:56,217 --> 01:12:58,811
Linnet was to take control over the dowry
when she turned 21

1050
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:00,211
or when she married.

1051
01:13:00,337 --> 01:13:02,897
And did this marriage, that was so sudden,
cause you any consternation?

1052
01:13:03,297 --> 01:13:04,935
- Why should it?
- Perhaps because her affairs

1053
01:13:05,057 --> 01:13:07,207
weren't in the perfect order
that they should be.

1054
01:13:07,337 --> 01:13:08,656
- What are you suggesting?
- Which she would have noticed

1055
01:13:08,777 --> 01:13:10,733
when she took control
on her return to England.

1056
01:13:10,857 --> 01:13:12,973
And that prospect so alarmed you,
- did it not? - that you rushed over

1057
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:16,487
and arranjed for a meeting that was
apparently fortuitous in Cairo?

1058
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:20,013
I did not! Her letter arrived a day
after I sailed on the Carmanic.

1059
01:13:20,137 --> 01:13:21,570
Then why did you,
on your luggage,

1060
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:24,086
you have only the labels of the Normandie,
that sailed two days later?

1061
01:13:24,257 --> 01:13:27,693
<i>Non, Mr. Paddington. It is the easiest thing
in the world to check the list of passengers.</i>

1062
01:13:27,817 --> 01:13:31,207
I believe that you came over here
to find a way out of the mess you were in

1063
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:33,096
and endeavored, without success,

1064
01:13:33,147 --> 01:13:35,297
to obtain the signature of Mme. Doyle
to certain documents.

1065
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:37,812
And while you were walking along the roof
of the Temple of Hathor,

1066
01:13:37,937 --> 01:13:40,815
you dislodged a statue head, which fell
very close to it's objective...

1067
01:13:40,937 --> 01:13:43,007
- That is crazy!
- And when a similar opportunity

1068
01:13:43,137 --> 01:13:44,889
presented itself on the return
journey home,

1069
01:13:45,377 --> 01:13:47,971
when her death would, almost certainly,
be described to somebody else,

1070
01:13:48,097 --> 01:13:49,894
not forgetting the fact, irrefutable,

1071
01:13:50,057 --> 01:13:52,332
that it was your gun that was used
to shoot and kill

1072
01:13:52,497 --> 01:13:55,011
a woman that was about to reveal
the identity of the murderer.

1073
01:13:55,137 --> 01:13:57,048
Three murders, Monsieur Pennington!

1074
01:13:57,177 --> 01:13:59,850
You may rest assured that the authorities
will conduct an investigation

1075
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,445
that wil be most thorough to the
condition of the estate of Madame Doyle.

1076
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:03,771
All right!

1077
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:11,127
It's because of this goddamn slum.
I was hoping that, with a little bit of luck,

1078
01:14:11,297 --> 01:14:14,653
I would have straightened everything up
by the time she would take control.

1079
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:17,695
And the statue head was what?
Was it an oportunity too tempting?

1080
01:14:17,817 --> 01:14:20,411
It was an accident! I tripped
over my golf club.

1081
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:27,050
And I didn't kill her either!

1082
01:14:27,857 --> 01:14:29,176
Do you hear me?

1083
01:14:29,337 --> 01:14:32,409
You're not gonna pin that on me,
and you never will.

1084
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:44,887
A spoiled brat, a domestic parasite
and a drunken old bag,

1085
01:14:45,017 --> 01:14:46,735
who cares wether they're dead
or not?

1086
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:48,893
You really are the rudest man...

1087
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:51,406
It's the future that matters, woman,
not the past.

1088
01:14:51,537 --> 01:14:54,210
Have you ever considered, for a single
second, that somebody, somewhere,

1089
01:14:54,337 --> 01:14:58,125
might be grieving by the poor maid
or how distraught Rosalie might be?

1090
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:01,415
And as for Linnet Doyle,
well, she was just so beautiful...

1091
01:15:03,137 --> 01:15:04,456
Ah! Unbelievable, isn't it?

1092
01:15:05,017 --> 01:15:07,850
Did you know that Cornelia's father
was pratically ruined

1093
01:15:08,017 --> 01:15:09,211
by Linnet's old man

1094
01:15:09,377 --> 01:15:12,335
and all she say is how beautiful
she was. Incredible!

1095
01:15:12,537 --> 01:15:15,415
I thought you said it's the future
that mattered, not the past.

1096
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,096
<i>Touché.</i>

1097
01:15:21,577 --> 01:15:23,010
Will you marry me?

1098
01:15:24,697 --> 01:15:27,052
- What?!
- It goes against all my principles,

1099
01:15:27,217 --> 01:15:29,447
I know, but I really think you should.
How about it?

1100
01:15:30,137 --> 01:15:32,014
It's a disgusting idea.

1101
01:15:33,017 --> 01:15:34,496
Is that a ''No''?

1102
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:37,006
You are opinionated, unreliable,

1103
01:15:37,297 --> 01:15:39,015
scrubby, unpleasant

1104
01:15:39,217 --> 01:15:41,777
and utterly...
utterly irritating.

1105
01:15:41,977 --> 01:15:44,537
- But apart from that...
- You see?

1106
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:53,249
Definitley smitten, I say. I think
I'll have a word with the old crow!

1107
01:15:54,337 --> 01:15:55,816
Quite a filled day for you, isn't it?

1108
01:15:55,937 --> 01:15:57,655
Everybody dropping like flies!

1109
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:04,452
Good afternoon.

1110
01:16:04,577 --> 01:16:07,091
To come straight to the point,
I want to marry your cousin.

1111
01:16:07,217 --> 01:16:09,447
In fact, I've already asked her.
Unfortunately, she declined,

1112
01:16:09,617 --> 01:16:10,811
but don't worry,

1113
01:16:10,937 --> 01:16:12,575
I'll keep on her turn, until
she says yes.

1114
01:16:12,697 --> 01:16:15,689
I can assure, sir,
I shall take steps to see

1115
01:16:15,817 --> 01:16:19,048
that she's not be subjected
to such persecution.

1116
01:16:19,337 --> 01:16:21,248
What exactly do you have against me?

1117
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,694
I'm not that bad, you see.
Anatomically, everything's in the right place,

1118
01:16:24,817 --> 01:16:27,172
it's in perfect working order
and I'm really quite bright,

1119
01:16:27,297 --> 01:16:28,446
so what seems to be the problem?

1120
01:16:28,577 --> 01:16:31,216
- Social position, Mr. Ferguson.
- Oh, I see.

1121
01:16:32,377 --> 01:16:36,928
Cornelia, come here. Have you been
behaving wrongly with this young man?

1122
01:16:37,257 --> 01:16:39,452
No! No, of course not...

1123
01:16:39,577 --> 01:16:41,727
Your cousin says
that I'm not good enough for you.

1124
01:16:42,057 --> 01:16:43,331
In the natural order of things,

1125
01:16:43,497 --> 01:16:45,488
she thinks that I'm the equivalent
of pond life.

1126
01:16:45,657 --> 01:16:47,773
- Is that how you see me?
- It's not that.

1127
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,976
- It's-- It's...?
- Yes...?

1128
01:16:58,457 --> 01:17:00,175
Isn't she wonderful?

1129
01:17:05,617 --> 01:17:08,450
Rather eccentric, I'm afraid,
like most of his family.

1130
01:17:08,937 --> 01:17:12,247
Well, he refuses to wear his title
because of his ideas progressive.

1131
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:17,212
<i>- Title?
- Oui, Lord Dawlish. You did not know?</i>

1132
01:17:18,257 --> 01:17:21,135
Oh, he is, how do you say it,
rolling in money, of course,

1133
01:17:21,257 --> 01:17:23,532
but he became a communiste on Oxford.

1134
01:17:23,937 --> 01:17:26,610
Lord... Dawlish?

1135
01:17:26,777 --> 01:17:28,613
I recognised him
from a picture on the paper,

1136
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,000
then I discovered the signet ring,

1137
01:17:30,337 --> 01:17:31,850
with the Dawlish coat of arms
on it.

1138
01:17:31,977 --> 01:17:33,695
There can be no doubt,
I assure you!

1139
01:17:34,377 --> 01:17:37,972
I am very much obliged to you,
Monsieur Poirot.

1140
01:17:42,137 --> 01:17:43,365
Ah! Monsieur Allerton,

1141
01:17:43,537 --> 01:17:45,493
I would like very much
to have a little word with you.

1142
01:17:45,617 --> 01:17:48,256
- What can I do for you?
- There's nothing you can do for me, Monsieur,

1143
01:17:48,417 --> 01:17:50,885
but to sit and to listen.
- Right... well,

1144
01:17:51,617 --> 01:17:53,209
I'm very good at that.

1145
01:17:54,177 --> 01:17:57,647
You can rely on me to say
''Whoa!'' on the right moments.

1146
01:17:57,977 --> 01:18:01,094
''Whoa!'' will do nicely.
Thank you.

1147
01:18:03,057 --> 01:18:04,331
<i>Merci.</i>

1148
01:18:05,457 --> 01:18:10,406
So, to begin, your friendship
with your cousin, Joanna Southwood.

1149
01:18:14,297 --> 01:18:18,336
For the past three years, Scotland Yard
has been preoccupied

1150
01:18:18,457 --> 01:18:20,448
with a number of jewelry robberies.

1151
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:24,047
And we know that the method
has been always the same.

1152
01:18:24,217 --> 01:18:26,412
<i>Oui, the substitution of the original
with an imitation.</i>

1153
01:18:26,737 --> 01:18:29,456
Atention soon focused
on Mademoiselle Southwood.

1154
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:33,929
You see, everyone of the victims
had been either a friend or an acquaintance.

1155
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:38,375
It also became clear that she did not
make the substitution herself.

1156
01:18:38,497 --> 01:18:40,170
<i>Non, non, non. She had a jeweler
who made a copy</i>

1157
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,331
and the substitution would be made
by someone else.

1158
01:18:42,977 --> 01:18:46,652
But the identity of this person
has remained a mistery.

1159
01:18:48,737 --> 01:18:50,375
<i>- Whoa!
- Oui.</i>

1160
01:18:50,657 --> 01:18:52,013
But over the past few days,
certain facts have emerged,

1161
01:18:52,057 --> 01:18:54,013
that have been most helpful.

1162
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:56,977
Your attendance at the house party
where had one of such robbery occurred,

1163
01:18:57,097 --> 01:18:59,611
your obvious resentments
of my presence here,

1164
01:19:00,017 --> 01:19:03,851
and the discovery that the pearls belonging
to Linnet Doyle were missing.

1165
01:19:04,017 --> 01:19:06,133
But what do I find?

1166
01:19:07,737 --> 01:19:10,092
I find that the pearls that were
stolen and returned

1167
01:19:10,217 --> 01:19:11,570
were an imitation,

1168
01:19:11,737 --> 01:19:14,695
previously substituted for
the real thing.

1169
01:19:14,937 --> 01:19:17,576
It would have been easy to Mademoiselle
Southwood find an oportunity

1170
01:19:17,697 --> 01:19:21,690
to examine the pearls of her friend
and to have made a copy.

1171
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:24,605
And it was then just a question
of waiting for the right moment

1172
01:19:24,737 --> 01:19:27,092
for you to make the substitution.

1173
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:30,889
<i>Et bien! But you learned that Linnet Doyle
was to honeymoon in Egypt, so hum!?...</i>

1174
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:32,655
<i>Parfait, hein?</i>

1175
01:19:33,177 --> 01:19:35,737
Mademoiselle Southwood
sent you the imitation,

1176
01:19:36,057 --> 01:19:38,412
concealed, I suggest in a packet
of books,

1177
01:19:39,537 --> 01:19:41,732
to you then, find your time.

1178
01:19:42,137 --> 01:19:43,934
Finally, you made the substitution,

1179
01:19:45,217 --> 01:19:46,809
returned to your cabin...

1180
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:50,654
... and concealed them by gluying them
into a rosary.

1181
01:19:52,377 --> 01:19:55,210
unfortunately for you, the night you chose
to do the did

1182
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:57,214
was the same night
when Linnet Doyle was murdered.

1183
01:19:57,337 --> 01:20:00,886
But more unfortunately was the fact
that someone saw you leave her cabin.

1184
01:20:02,977 --> 01:20:06,333
"Whoa!", would you not say,
Monsieur Allerton?

1185
01:20:08,777 --> 01:20:11,291
- Who saw me?
- Mademoiselle Rosalie Otterbourne.

1186
01:20:11,417 --> 01:20:14,090
<i>- And she told you?
- Non. In fact, when I taxed her with it,</i>

1187
01:20:14,257 --> 01:20:16,327
she lied.
- Why?

1188
01:20:18,457 --> 01:20:20,732
Perhaps because she thought the man
she saw

1189
01:20:21,777 --> 01:20:23,130
was the murderer.

1190
01:20:25,697 --> 01:20:27,176
Surely, not thinking that...

1191
01:20:27,297 --> 01:20:30,050
Was Madame Doyle alive or dead
when you stole the pearls?

1192
01:20:31,057 --> 01:20:34,049
I don't know. I... really don't know.

1193
01:20:34,377 --> 01:20:35,730
Could you hear her breathing?

1194
01:20:37,257 --> 01:20:39,009
I--I couldn't say.

1195
01:20:40,137 --> 01:20:41,616
Now listen, you young twerp,

1196
01:20:41,777 --> 01:20:45,486
Monsieur Poirot here, can build
a case against you, that's so rock solid

1197
01:20:45,517 --> 01:20:47,775
that you'll be hanging
from some gallows

1198
01:20:47,815 --> 01:20:49,775
before you can even draw
a breath to say "False!".

1199
01:20:50,857 --> 01:20:54,133
I didn't murder anyone! I admit
I substituted the pearls,

1200
01:20:54,337 --> 01:20:56,976
but murder no! I swear!

1201
01:20:57,777 --> 01:21:00,371
It would make a very good case,
I assure you.

1202
01:21:01,497 --> 01:21:05,410
I suggest that, when I examine
the rosary, I will find nothing there,

1203
01:21:05,937 --> 01:21:07,913
and, since
Mademoiselle Otterbourne

1204
01:21:08,013 --> 01:21:09,293
asserts on saying
that she saw no one

1205
01:21:09,417 --> 01:21:11,851
on the deck last night,
for this particular theft,

1206
01:21:11,977 --> 01:21:14,616
there is no case against you.

1207
01:21:15,217 --> 01:21:19,051
The pearls were taken
by a cleptomaniac

1208
01:21:19,937 --> 01:21:22,405
who has since returned.

1209
01:21:25,697 --> 01:21:27,255
I... don't know what to say, Mr. P.

1210
01:21:27,697 --> 01:21:30,416
Under the circumstances,
Mr. A,

1211
01:21:32,097 --> 01:21:34,452
I will suggest that this is not
a bad thing.

1212
01:21:44,137 --> 01:21:45,857
So that's that.

1213
01:21:45,907 --> 01:21:48,927
Now all I have to do is return
the real thing to Mr. Poirot.

1214
01:21:50,097 --> 01:21:53,931
- Why didn't you say you'd seen me?
- I thought they might suspect you.

1215
01:21:54,857 --> 01:21:57,371
- Did you suspect me?
- No.

1216
01:21:58,177 --> 01:22:01,965
- I knew you couldn't kill anyone.
- A miserable little thief, that's all I am.

1217
01:22:18,497 --> 01:22:21,136
Barking up the wrong tree,
I'm afraid.

1218
01:22:22,777 --> 01:22:24,335
Timothy...

1219
01:22:44,577 --> 01:22:45,805
<i>Mademoiselle,</i>

1220
01:22:46,017 --> 01:22:47,245
<i>Messieurs,</i>

1221
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:48,930
I am pleased to inform you

1222
01:22:49,057 --> 01:22:51,730
that the picture,
it is finally complete.

1223
01:22:51,857 --> 01:22:53,256
<i>Et bien, where to begin?</i>

1224
01:22:55,497 --> 01:22:56,607
You know, our big mistake,

1225
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:58,807
and unbelievable that
I should go along with it,

1226
01:22:59,337 --> 01:23:02,215
was to suppose that this crime was
spontaneous. Not so.

1227
01:23:02,337 --> 01:23:05,010
It was worked out meticulously
in every detail,

1228
01:23:05,137 --> 01:23:10,769
even to the drugging of
the bottle of wine of Hercule Poirot!

1229
01:23:11,417 --> 01:23:13,851
I was put to sleep, so there
should be no possibility of participating

1230
01:23:13,977 --> 01:23:16,571
in the events of the night.

1231
01:23:16,977 --> 01:23:19,445
Nothing easier than to place
a narcotic into my bottle,

1232
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:21,454
which stands on the table
of the dining room.

1233
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:26,928
<i>And my sleepinness...  Et bien,
it had been a hot day.</i>

1234
01:23:28,457 --> 01:23:31,688
The drugging of the wine, it had
to take place before dinner, at 19:30,

1235
01:23:31,817 --> 01:23:33,580
but, you know, even then,

1236
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:36,368
premeditation was very far
from my mind.

1237
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:40,170
The first blow
to our preconceived idea

1238
01:23:41,337 --> 01:23:44,150
was when the revolver
was recovered from the River Nile.

1239
01:23:44,197 --> 01:23:45,660
If we had been correct,

1240
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,412
the revolver would never have been
thrown overboard.

1241
01:23:48,777 --> 01:23:51,450
Also the stole which was wrapped
around the pistol

1242
01:23:51,617 --> 01:23:53,847
showed the signs
that it had been fired through,

1243
01:23:53,977 --> 01:23:57,128
but the bullet wounds
showed signs of scorching.

1244
01:23:57,417 --> 01:24:00,648
Which is to say the revolver had
been placed against her head

1245
01:24:00,817 --> 01:24:03,570
and we knew the stole was not
used against you, Monsieur Doyle,

1246
01:24:03,697 --> 01:24:05,653
because there are two witnesses
to prove it.

1247
01:24:05,777 --> 01:24:10,089
Therefore, a third shot must have been
fired, about which we knew nothing.

1248
01:24:10,777 --> 01:24:14,611
Next came the two bottles.

1249
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:18,015
Madame Doyle always painted
her nails ''Cardinal'',

1250
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:20,207
a red color that was deep
and dark.

1251
01:24:20,337 --> 01:24:22,976
The other bottle was ''Rose'',
a shade of pink.

1252
01:24:23,137 --> 01:24:26,368
But the few drops that were remaining
were bright red

1253
01:24:26,737 --> 01:24:29,376
and, instead of the usual odor
of pale drops,

1254
01:24:29,537 --> 01:24:32,176
this bottle smelled of ink.

1255
01:24:32,657 --> 01:24:34,229
This linked it with
the handkerchief

1256
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:35,739
that was also stained
bright red,

1257
01:24:35,897 --> 01:24:37,967
and wrapped around the revolver.

1258
01:24:38,217 --> 01:24:41,129
Then an event ocurred which
rended all the doubts superfluous.

1259
01:24:41,297 --> 01:24:44,892
When I asked Louise Bourget,
the maid, if she'd seen anything, she said.:

1260
01:24:45,137 --> 01:24:47,367
It is not possible
I should hear anything,

1261
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:51,787
unless I could not sleep
and came back up.

1262
01:24:52,197 --> 01:24:55,133
Then perhaps I see something,

1263
01:24:55,897 --> 01:25:00,334
this... monster enter or leave
my mistress's cabin.

1264
01:25:00,737 --> 01:25:02,375
But why say all this to us?

1265
01:25:02,777 --> 01:25:05,689
If she knew who was the murderer,
why not tell it to us,

1266
01:25:06,617 --> 01:25:10,986
or hold her tongue and
demand money from the guilty person?

1267
01:25:11,157 --> 01:25:13,013
But she does neither.
Why?

1268
01:25:14,577 --> 01:25:16,249
There could only be one reason,

1269
01:25:17,497 --> 01:25:20,455
because she was hinting
to the murderer.

1270
01:25:21,657 --> 01:25:24,455
Therefore, the murderer
must have been present.

1271
01:25:29,697 --> 01:25:31,050
Oh! You're accusing me?

1272
01:25:31,177 --> 01:25:33,566
But why would you kill her, Dr. Bessner?
And you, Monsieur Doyle?

1273
01:25:33,777 --> 01:25:35,822
There are witnesses to swear that
you didn't leave the lounge

1274
01:25:35,852 --> 01:25:37,292
before the quarrel broke out,

1275
01:25:37,417 --> 01:25:39,806
and then you were wounded in the leg,
making it physically impossible.

1276
01:25:39,977 --> 01:25:42,013
So no, Dr. Bessner
must be the guilty one,

1277
01:25:42,177 --> 01:25:45,374
but... why should Louise, the maid,
be hinting to Dr. Bessner?

1278
01:25:45,537 --> 01:25:47,653
She could have spoken to him
any time she wanted.

1279
01:25:47,777 --> 01:25:49,813
<i>So... non! There was one person,
and one person only,</i>

1280
01:25:49,937 --> 01:25:52,405
who corresponded to her necessity.

1281
01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:57,369
Simon Doyle!

1282
01:26:01,937 --> 01:26:03,529
I say!

1283
01:26:05,497 --> 01:26:08,648
Poppycock (nonsense)!
Absolute poppycock!

1284
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:12,448
You were constantly attended to,
she might not have another chance.

1285
01:26:12,577 --> 01:26:16,536
Monsieur, I implore you!
You know how it is... What can I say?

1286
01:26:16,657 --> 01:26:18,249
Calm down, for Heaven's sake!

1287
01:26:18,377 --> 01:26:20,732
You'll be alright.
I'll look after you.

1288
01:26:20,857 --> 01:26:24,213
And that was the assurance that
she wanted and she got it.

1289
01:26:24,337 --> 01:26:27,056
- Impossible! The man could not move!
- Exactly!

1290
01:26:27,497 --> 01:26:30,569
- This is an outrage!
- But what had actually been seen?

1291
01:26:31,057 --> 01:26:32,410
Miss de Bellefort!

1292
01:26:32,577 --> 01:26:35,171
I'll shoot you like a dog!
Like the dirty dog that you are!

1293
01:26:35,297 --> 01:26:37,606
Mr. Ferguson! Mr. Ferguson!

1294
01:26:48,017 --> 01:26:49,336
And what then?

1295
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:51,453
Get her out of here, for God's sake!
Take her to her cabin!

1296
01:26:51,577 --> 01:26:53,488
And don't let her be left alone,
whatever you do!

1297
01:26:53,617 --> 01:26:55,653
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Doyle!
I'll stay with her.

1298
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:57,529
And get Dr. Bessner
to take care of me.

1299
01:26:57,657 --> 01:26:59,568
But all of these cabins
were on the port side.

1300
01:26:59,697 --> 01:27:01,767
The cabin of your wife,
Monsieur Doyle,

1301
01:27:01,937 --> 01:27:03,609
it was on the starboard side.

1302
01:27:03,777 --> 01:27:05,529
So, this was your only chance

1303
01:27:05,697 --> 01:27:08,131
and a few minutes were
all that you needed.

1304
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:11,086
You see, what had been witnessed

1305
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,086
was not
what actually happened.

1306
01:28:51,137 --> 01:28:52,695
Monsieur Allerton
heard a pop...

1307
01:28:52,817 --> 01:28:54,569
He heard a splash,

1308
01:28:54,697 --> 01:28:55,895
and he heard something else:

1309
01:28:55,925 --> 01:28:58,485
the footsteps of someone
running past his door.

1310
01:28:58,857 --> 01:29:02,611
Now, who could possibly be running
on the starboard side? No one.

1311
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:05,048
Except Simon Doyle.

1312
01:29:05,817 --> 01:29:07,648
You cooked all that up yourself?

1313
01:29:07,777 --> 01:29:09,847
But that's all nonsense!
Downright slander!

1314
01:29:09,917 --> 01:29:11,120
As I have said,

1315
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:13,254
it looked as if this crime could have
been committed in the spur of the moment.

1316
01:29:13,297 --> 01:29:14,855
<i>But, non, non, it was not.</i>

1317
01:29:15,497 --> 01:29:18,330
It was not an accident that you had
in your pocket red ink,

1318
01:29:18,457 --> 01:29:21,608
it was not an accidente that the revolver
was kicked under the chair.

1319
01:29:21,737 --> 01:29:23,090
<i>- Jacqueline!
- Oui.</i>

1320
01:29:23,257 --> 01:29:24,849
Who gives to Monsieur Doyle his alibi?

1321
01:29:24,977 --> 01:29:28,128
The shooting of him by Jacqueline.
Who gives to Jacqueline hers?

1322
01:29:28,457 --> 01:29:31,654
You, Mademoiselle Robson, staying
with her all of the night at his insistence.

1323
01:29:31,777 --> 01:29:35,326
Oh, the two halves of the murder,
with all the qualities required:

1324
01:29:35,697 --> 01:29:37,813
the cool, resourceful plan
of Jacqueline,

1325
01:29:37,937 --> 01:29:41,213
and the man of action to carry it out.
They had been lovers...

1326
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:44,414
Realize that they are still lovers
and it all makes sense.

1327
01:29:45,857 --> 01:29:50,806
But then, your plan goes horribly wrong,
does it not, Monsieur Doyle?

1328
01:29:51,337 --> 01:29:54,010
For Louise, the maid, sees you
and hints you that she requires

1329
01:29:54,137 --> 01:29:56,412
the money for hushing her up.

1330
01:29:56,537 --> 01:29:57,572
You manage to inform Jacqueline

1331
01:29:57,737 --> 01:30:00,092
and tell to her where Doctor Hessner
keeps his scalpels.

1332
01:30:07,297 --> 01:30:10,573
<i>Et presto!...
She returns the scalpel,</i>

1333
01:30:11,297 --> 01:30:13,527
hurries into lunch,
rather late and breathless.

1334
01:30:13,697 --> 01:30:16,291
But still, all is not well,
Madame Otterbourne saw her,

1335
01:30:16,457 --> 01:30:19,335
rushes in to tell us.
You raised your voice to her...

1336
01:30:19,537 --> 01:30:21,607
You saw the person who killed
my wife?

1337
01:30:21,777 --> 01:30:24,655
Nerves, I thought.
But the door was open

1338
01:30:24,777 --> 01:30:26,335
and you were hinting of the danger

1339
01:30:26,457 --> 01:30:29,494
to your partner in crime...
she acted like lightening.

1340
01:30:29,977 --> 01:30:33,253
She remembered that Monsieur Pennington
had in his cabin a gun.

1341
01:30:34,777 --> 01:30:36,813
Cracked behind the curtain here, and...

1342
01:30:38,697 --> 01:30:40,653
Another problem solved.

1343
01:30:41,097 --> 01:30:42,928
I am correct, am I not, Monsieur Doyle?

1344
01:30:43,057 --> 01:30:45,890
What happened to the first bullet
fired by the girl?

1345
01:30:46,017 --> 01:30:47,928
What is the matter, Monsieur Doyle,
has the cat got you by the tongue?

1346
01:30:48,057 --> 01:30:49,376
It went into the settee.

1347
01:30:49,497 --> 01:30:51,727
Removed it and threw it out
of the window.

1348
01:30:52,217 --> 01:30:54,208
You also carried with you
a spare cartridge

1349
01:30:54,337 --> 01:30:56,373
to make it look as if two bullets
had been fired...

1350
01:30:56,537 --> 01:30:58,050
Did you not, Monsieur Doyle?

1351
01:30:59,097 --> 01:31:02,373
<i>A crime that was almost parfait,</i>

1352
01:31:03,377 --> 01:31:06,050
you kill your wife, you inherit her money
and, in due course,

1353
01:31:06,177 --> 01:31:07,929
you marry your true love.

1354
01:31:08,097 --> 01:31:11,772
It seems as if you did tought of everything,
Monsieur Doyle, except for one thing.

1355
01:31:15,537 --> 01:31:16,936
Hercule Poirot.

1356
01:31:20,537 --> 01:31:23,609
I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

1357
01:31:24,097 --> 01:31:25,655
Oh, there, there, Monsieur Doyle.

1358
01:31:27,137 --> 01:31:28,490
The executioner here

1359
01:31:30,297 --> 01:31:32,128
is very eficient.

1360
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:36,131
<i>Non, the mechanism
it works like clockwork...</i>

1361
01:31:37,417 --> 01:31:38,770
... as a rule.

1362
01:31:41,137 --> 01:31:44,095
I love him to death.
I can't help it.

1363
01:31:46,937 --> 01:31:49,212
As I say,
love makes you do things...

1364
01:31:52,097 --> 01:31:56,295
We... worked everything out,
so carefully,

1365
01:32:00,457 --> 01:32:04,132
but even then he went and wrote a ''J''
in the wall in her blood,

1366
01:32:05,737 --> 01:32:07,648
such a stupid thing,

1367
01:32:07,977 --> 01:32:10,411
but absolutely typical.

1368
01:32:13,617 --> 01:32:15,335
So, we got away with it.

1369
01:32:16,657 --> 01:32:18,170
Until Louise Bourget,

1370
01:32:19,777 --> 01:32:23,326
how do you say,
put a spinel in the works.

1371
01:32:26,297 --> 01:32:29,767
- Yes, I can't believe I did that.
- And then Madame Otterbourne.

1372
01:32:32,777 --> 01:32:36,690
It's so dreadfully easy killing people,
Monsieur Poirot.

1373
01:32:38,497 --> 01:32:40,727
You begin to feel it doesn't matter.

1374
01:32:46,977 --> 01:32:50,367
That evening, in the grounds of the hotel,
when you said you saw someone...

1375
01:32:52,297 --> 01:32:54,413
... ther was no person there, was there?

1376
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:59,449
Just a little red herring,

1377
01:32:59,897 --> 01:33:01,455
to keep you on your toes.

1378
01:33:04,897 --> 01:33:07,934
Do you remember when I said
I must follow my star?

1379
01:33:11,417 --> 01:33:13,408
It's finally burned out, hasn't it?

1380
01:33:23,817 --> 01:33:26,331
Monsieur Pennington, you must be
happy to return home.

1381
01:33:26,457 --> 01:33:28,493
I'm not sure
if I got a home to go, still,

1382
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,734
but thanks for asking.

1383
01:33:33,737 --> 01:33:35,216
<i>- I'm sure he'll get by.
- Oui.</i>

1384
01:33:39,017 --> 01:33:40,245
Mademoiselle.

1385
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:46,887
Monsieur Poirot! Wonderful news!
I've decided to get married!

1386
01:33:47,337 --> 01:33:49,487
That is most wonderful,
indeed, Mademoiselle.

1387
01:33:49,617 --> 01:33:51,653
- Who is the lucky man?
- Dr. Bessner.

1388
01:33:52,137 --> 01:33:54,935
- Bessner?!
- He asked me last night.

1389
01:33:55,337 --> 01:33:58,056
He's so kind. He says I can
help him in his work.

1390
01:33:58,257 --> 01:34:00,452
He's gonna teach me all about neurosis.

1391
01:34:00,617 --> 01:34:02,733
May I offer you my congratulations,
Mademoiselle?

1392
01:34:02,897 --> 01:34:04,455
- Hear, hear.
- Thank you.

1393
01:34:04,617 --> 01:34:08,292
- Have you told your cousin this news?
- Oh, yes! She's absolutely thrilled.

1394
01:34:09,537 --> 01:34:11,892
Dr. Bessner, I offer you
my congratulations, also.

1395
01:34:12,017 --> 01:34:14,167
<i>Danke schon, danke schon,
we are very happy.</i>

1396
01:34:14,297 --> 01:34:15,696
Yes.

1397
01:34:17,737 --> 01:34:22,413
- I'm sorry.
- Yes. I'm not very experienced

1398
01:34:22,617 --> 01:34:25,529
in these matters, you see?
I thought I'd struck gold.

1399
01:34:25,697 --> 01:34:28,814
It happens, Monsieur Ferguson,

1400
01:34:30,177 --> 01:34:32,452
more often
than one might suppose.

1401
01:34:33,617 --> 01:34:35,448
<i>- Goodbye.
- Au revoir.</i>

1402
01:34:35,657 --> 01:34:36,851
Coronel.

1403
01:35:01,297 --> 01:35:03,208
Who would have thought
it would come to this?

1404
01:35:03,737 --> 01:35:06,490
It was you, Mademoiselle who said
that life was unfair.

1405
01:35:06,657 --> 01:35:08,136
Hello, Simon.

1406
01:35:09,337 --> 01:35:13,376
I messed up again, didn't I?
Confessed a lot. I'm sorry...

1407
01:35:14,257 --> 01:35:18,330
It's a fool's game, my darling,
and we've lost, that's all.

1408
01:35:21,457 --> 01:35:25,416
Please, may I kiss him? I'm not sure
I'll get another chance.

1409
01:35:34,577 --> 01:35:35,930
Goodbye, my darling.

1410
01:35:39,297 --> 01:35:41,208
You know how much I love you...

1411
01:35:45,377 --> 01:35:46,605
Goodbye.

1412
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:53,649
- Where the devil did she get that?
- She had two of them.

1413
01:35:53,857 --> 01:35:57,167
She set it in your handbag, Mademoiselle,
in the day of the search

1414
01:35:57,297 --> 01:36:00,607
and retrieved later,
when she visited your cabin.

1415
01:36:03,057 --> 01:36:04,615
You knew?

1416
01:36:08,097 --> 01:36:09,974
It is not always that simple.

1417
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:16,100
... love is the sweetest thing ...

1418
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:21,500
... what else on eath
could ever bring ...
